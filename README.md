# StarWarsAnalysis

Hello! This is the Git Hub repo for the Digit 210 Spring 2022 group project. We plan on searching into the movie scripts of the Star Wars Original trilogy; A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. We want to dive into the different scenes that changed throughout the different iterations of the movies. 

As a group we are: Joey, Felipe, Thomas, and Harrison.
