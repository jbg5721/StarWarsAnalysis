A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
	A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
	title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup 
	slowly crawls into infinity.
   It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic
Empire.
   During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station
with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
   Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
	The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
	eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
	silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from
	the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a
	giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts
	streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar
	fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN PASSAGEWAY.</setting>
<sd>	An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2)
	and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the
	shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. 
	Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of
	computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the
	other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He
	has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco
	design. 
		 Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their
	way.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll
be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
		</sp><sd> Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions
	in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> We're doomed!
		</sp><sd> The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
	only another robot could understand.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
		</sp><sd> Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
	loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
	are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> What's that?
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: SPACECRAFT IN SPACE.</setting>
<sd>	The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
	Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
	underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.</setting>
<sd>	The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
	tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a
	score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their
	way into the smoke-filled corridor.
		 In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
	laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
	creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
	behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
	who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
	arms and faces.
		 An explosion hits near the robots.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I should have known better than to trust the logic of a
half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
		</sp><sd> Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
	around the two hapless robots.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT WASTELAND -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The
	tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure,
	Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks
	much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and
	baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with
	a prize-winning smile.
		 A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
	large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
	desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by
	a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
	appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
	A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he
	instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility
	belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the
	heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
	Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
	above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny
	robot to follow him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
		</sp><sd> The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
	smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms
	up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his
	Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN HALLWAY.</setting>
<sd>	The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his
	way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is
	Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured
	by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
	stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
	Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from
	the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the
	Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a
	frenzied panic.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.</setting>
<sd>	A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
	Artoo makes beeping sounds.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.</setting>
<sd>	Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
	nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
	soldiers can be heard in the distance.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
		</sp><sd> A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
	he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a
	smoke-filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen
	years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,
	dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
	something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
	robot joins his companion.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> At last! Where have you been?</sp>
	<sd>Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows
what!
		</sp><sd> Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
	subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Wait a minute, where are you going?
		</sp><sd> Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- CORRIDOR</setting>
<sd>	The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
	of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
	an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>IMPERIAL OFFICER</speaker> The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
		</sp><sd> Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
	in vain.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
		</sp><sd> Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> What have you done with those plans?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>REBEL OFFICER</speaker> We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a
consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador?
		</sp><sd> The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
	Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
	gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
	Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
	his troops.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans
and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
		</sp><sd> The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.</setting>
<sd>	The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
	stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
	Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes
	slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the
	approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers
	spots her.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker> There she is! Set for stun!
		</sp><sd> Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
	her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
	paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker> She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.</setting>
<sd>	Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He
	snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
	begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the
	cramped four-man pod.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll
be deactivated for sure..
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps something to him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of
grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
		</sp><sd> Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
	the mission he is about to perform.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm
not getting in there!
		</sp><sd> Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
	and twangs angrily.
	A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
	through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,
	after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky
	robot jumps into the lifepod.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I'm going to regret this.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER.</setting>
<sd>	On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified
	robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF PILOT</speaker> There goes another one.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker> Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been
short-circuited.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: LIFEPOD.</setting>
<sd>	Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
	Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.</sp>
	<sd>Artoo beeps an assuring response.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Are you sure this things safe?
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
	buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty
	street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of
	the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as
	he flies past.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>WOMAN</speaker> I've told you kids to slow down!
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: POWER STATION -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged
	mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
	asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the
	office, yelling wildly.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIXER</speaker> Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAMIE</speaker> It was just wormie on another rampage.
		</sp><sd> Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
	and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
	playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
	handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city
	attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the
	farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Shape it up you guys!.... Biggs?
		</sp><sd> Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to
	great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be
here...certainly didn't expect you to be out working. (he laughs.)
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon?
Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
		</sp><sd> Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.
First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...(he salutes)...I just
came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
		</sp><sd> Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing
	friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out
	of it.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our
system. Come and look!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker> Not again! Forget it.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD -- SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and
	The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke
	has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> There they are!
		</sp><sd> Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain
	to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
	Biggs sees two small silver specks.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> That's no battle, hot shot...they're just sitting there!
Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But there was a lot of firing earlier...
		</sp><sd> Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
	building in the process. Luke grabs them.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Hey, easy with those...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAMIE</speaker> Don't worry about it, Wormie.
		</sp><sd> The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy
	shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIXER</speaker> I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I
doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me
Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
		</sp><sd> Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
	group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
	Luke's ineptitude.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- HALLWAY</setting>
<sd>	Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
	of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is
	brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
	marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
	emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard
	at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The
Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked
a diplomatic...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any
mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted
system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the
Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her
away!
		</sp><sd> Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the
	smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial
	Commander turns to Vader.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker> Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it
could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link
to find their secret base!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker> She'll die before she tells you anything.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the
senate that all aboard were killed!
		</sp><sd> Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the
	Commander. They stop and snap to attention.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>SECOND OFFICER</speaker> Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard
this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was
jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
		</sp><sd> Vader turns to the Commander.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a
detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker> Yes, sir.
</sp>

<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: SPACE.</setting>
<sd>	The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the
	planet Tatooine.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT.</setting>
<sd>	Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas
	meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
	kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
	work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the
	distance rests half buried in the sand.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We
seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
		</sp><sd> Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost
frozen. 
		</sp><sd> Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> What a desolate place this is.
		</sp><sd> Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and
	starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
	stops and yells at him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Where are you going?
		</sp><sd> A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
	robot.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way
is much easier.
		</sp><sd> Artoo counters with a long whistle.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> What makes you think there are settlements over there?
		</sp><sd> Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Don't get technical with me.
		</sp><sd> Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just
about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a
day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
		</sp><sd> Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in
	the direction of the vast dune sea.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> And don't let me catch you following me begging for help,
because you won't get it.
		</sp><sd> Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
	off in the direction of the towering mesas.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the
	distant mountains.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DUNE SEA.</setting>
<sd>	Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune;
	only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless
	miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock
	mesas. 
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He
tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
		</sp><sd> In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the
	sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint
	of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
	towards him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!
		</sp><sd> The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
	approaching transport.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Over here! Help! Please, help!
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and
	the others can be heard working inside.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (Very animated)...so I cut off my power, shut down the
afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest
of the season. You should have been there...it was fantastic.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest
bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are
dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing
more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant
starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft
in the city...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> I've missed you kid.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's
been so...quiet.
		</sp><sd> Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye...I shouldn't
tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust...and if I don't
come back, I want somebody to know.
		</sp><sd> Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What are you talking about?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> I made some friends at the Academy. (he whispers)...when our
frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship
and join the Alliance...
		</sp><sd> Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor
crater!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I'm sorry. I'm quiet. (he whispers) Listen how quiet I am. You
can barely hear me...
		</sp><sd> Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make
contact.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Your crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what
I can on my own...It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not
going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion
is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe
in. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> And I'm stuck here...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get
your chance to get off this rock.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot
of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left...they've even raided
the outskirts of Anchorhead.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one
blaster.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place
pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems
to be important or what really is important. What good is all your
uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...You know they're
starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be
long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater
glory of the Empire.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't
bother with this rock.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Things always change.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I wish I was going...Are you going to be around long? 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> No, I'm leaving in the morning...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Then I guess I won't see you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Maybe someday...I'll keep a lookout.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, I'll be at the Academy next season...after that who knows.
I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...Take
care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> So long, Luke.

	power station.

<sd>	The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
	foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
	fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
	canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes.
	He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a
	moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
		 In the distance, a pepple tumbles down the steep canyon
	wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little
	further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair
	of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow
	path.
		 The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
	suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
	of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one
	short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back.
	His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off
	again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than
	Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they
	cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and
	their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
	seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the
	heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the
	trail.

<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SANDCRAWLER -- SUNSET.</setting>
<sd>	The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge
	tank-like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a
	small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large
	tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked
	into the giant machine.
		 The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
	and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: SANDCRAWLER -- HOLD AREA.</setting>
<sd>	It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo
	switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
	around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty
	metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
	maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper
	and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end
	of the chamber.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: SANDCRAWLER -- PRISON AREA.</setting>
<sd>	Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the
	middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various
	shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation,
	while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls
	out from the gloom.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
		</sp><sd> A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SANDCRAWLER -- SUNSET.</setting>
<sd>	The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent
	twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain
	ridge.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
	buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A
	trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIRST TROOPER</speaker> Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this
direction. 
		</sp><sd> A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand
	and gives it to the first trooper.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>SECOND TROOPER</speaker> Look, sir -- droids.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DUNES.</setting>
<sd>	The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: SANDCRAWLER.</setting>
<sd>	Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped
	prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Wake up! Wake up!
		</sp><sd> Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,
	creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
	Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights
	pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long
	chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white
	light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd
	assortment of robots.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> We're doomed.
		</sp><sd> A Jawa starts moving toward them.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Do you think they'll melt us down?
		</sp><sd> Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT -- LARS HOMESTEAD -- AFTERNOON.</setting>
<sd>	The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
	battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of
	the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
	homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
	surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small
	adobe block house.
		 The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,
	straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented
	metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly,
	attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths
	and nostrils should be.
		 Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen
	Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes
	are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully
	inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-
	shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little
	Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales
	pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
		 A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
	homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru
	standing in the main courtyard.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker> Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it
speaks Bocce.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind
him.
		</sp><sd> Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment
	for sale with the Jawa leader.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> I have no need for a protocol droid.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> (quickly) Sir -- not in an environment such as this --
that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary
functions that...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> What I really need is a droid that understands the binary
language of moisture vaporators.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load
lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Do you speak Bocce?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for
me...I'm as fluent in Bocce...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> All right shut up! (turning to Jawa) I'll take this one.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Shutting up, sir.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to
have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power
converters...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
Now come on, get to it!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on,
Red, let's go.
		</sp><sd> As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots
	back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little
	beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is
	restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
</sd>		<sd> Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two
	robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head
	of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Uncle Owen...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Yeah?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> (to the head Jawa) Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
		</sp><sd> The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has
	sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to
	attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio
	taps Luke on the shoulder.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in
prime condition. A real bargain.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Uncle Owen...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Yeah?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What about that one?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
		</sp><sd> With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the
	damaged astro-droid for Artoo.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Yeah, take it away.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one,
sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him
before. Here he comes.
		</sp><sd> Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots
	trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Okay, let's go.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> (to Artoo) Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my
neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- GARAGE AREA -- LATE AFTERNOON.</setting>
<sd>	The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful
	atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers
	himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the
	battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery
	with a cord to his face.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in
	thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small
	two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the
	garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and
	he slams a wrench across the workbench.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out
of here!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Is there anything I might do to help? 
		</sp><sd> Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger
	drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or
teleport me off this rock!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a
matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the
planet that it's farthest from.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I see, sir.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Uh, you can call me Luke.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I see, sir Luke.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (laughing) Just Luke.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is
my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Hello.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to
	scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome
	pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil
	from his bronze body.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my
meaning, sir.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Have you been in many battles?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm
not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling
stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
		</sp><sd> Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's
	neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real
good. Were you on a cruiser or...
		</sp><sd> The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke
	tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch
	three-dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,
	being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a
	rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit
	garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What's this?
		</sp><sd> Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for
	Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence
	fragment over and over.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> What is what?!? He asked you a question...(pointing to Leia)
What is that?
		</sp><sd> Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice
	the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer
	for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the
	sentence fragment over and over.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan
Kenobi. You're my only hope.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old
data. Pay it no mind.
		</sp><sd> Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Who is she? She's beautiful.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of
some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Is there more to this recording?
		</sp><sd> Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic
	squeaks and a whistle.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble.
It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
		</sp><sd> Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of
these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I
don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain
Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking
about?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out
beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
		</sp><sd> Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few
	moments. 
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better
play back the whole thing.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his
recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be
able to play back the entire recording.
		</sp><sd> Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and
	hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me
if I take this off! Okay.
		</sp><sd> Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off
	Artoo's side.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> There you go.
		</sp><sd> The princess immediately disappears...
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back
the entire message.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in
	embarrassment.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty
innards! 
		</sp><sd> A women's voice calls out from another room.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>AUNT BERU</speaker> Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
		</sp><sd> Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning
	robot.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight
flutter.
		</sp><sd> Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and
	hurries out of the room.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps in response.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> No, I don't think he likes you at all.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> No, I don't like you either.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- DINING AREA.</setting>
<sd>	 Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher
	with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-used
	kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of
	food and starts for the dining area.
		 Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with
	steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red
	grain.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> What makes you think that?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He
says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
		</sp><sd> Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but
	manages to control himself.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's
talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
		</sp><sd> Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to
take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll
be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the
same time as your father.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> He knew my father?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new
droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge
working out those condensers.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine.
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying
on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to
transmit my application to the Academy this year.
		</sp><sd> Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress
	it.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> You mean the next semester before harvest?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Sure, there're more than enough droids.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This
year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some
more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.
		</sp><sd> Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his
	uncle.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> You must understand I need you here, Luke.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But it's a whole 'nother year.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Look, it's only one more season.
		</sp><sd> Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT BERU</speaker> Where are you going?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those
droids.
		</sp><sd> Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen
	mechanically finishes his dinner.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>AUNT BERU</speaker> Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have
gone. It means so much to him.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT BERU</speaker> Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his
father in him.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> That's what I'm afraid of.

	similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the
	box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a
	short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What are you doing hiding there?
		</sp><sd> Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in
	sight. 
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told
him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about
his mission.

	flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids
are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at
times. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to
wait until morning.

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker> Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.</sp>
	<sd>He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

		</sp><sd> Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the
	wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I
don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have
missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate
you for a day or so...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed
his restraining bolt...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like
our droid...hit the accelerator.

<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK MESA -- DUNE SEA -- COASTLINE -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen
	gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground
	two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert
	cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the
	marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle
	and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the
	gun before it can be fired.
		 The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes
	called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into
	an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in
	the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK MESA -- CANYON.</setting>
<sd>	The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied
	to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as
	elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and
	long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount
	saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride
	off down the rugged bluff.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- FLOOR.</setting>
<sd>	The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke,
	with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands
	before little Artoo.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
		</sp><sd> The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses
	menacingly behind the little runaway.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your
mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million
pieces right here.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back
before Uncle Owen really blows up.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should
deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your
workshop.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> No, he's not going to try anything.
		</sp><sd> Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of
	frantic whistles and screams.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What's wrong with him now?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching
from the southeast.
		</sp><sd> Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- RIDGE -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and
	scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the two
	riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young
	adventurer.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a
second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
		</sp><sd> Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his
	electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of
	his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large,
	gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled
	and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be
	heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down
	the side of the mountain.
</sd>		<sd> The towering creature brings down his curved,
	double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has
	struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke
	manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is
	smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward
	until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister
	Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a
	horrible shrieking laugh.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- FLOOR -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the
	rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert
	Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder.
	The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and
	supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then
	everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is
	heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople
	fleeing in terror.
		 Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight
	swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even
	closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and
	leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and
	weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating
	eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes
	as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a
	slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.</sp>
	<sd>Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a 
	heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben
	puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to 
	come around.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Don't worry, he'll be all right.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What happened?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're
still in one piece.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
Luke, what brings you out this far?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former
master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there
seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking 
about?</sp>
	<sd>Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a 
long time...a long time.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You know him!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by
the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Then the droid does belong to you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...</sp>
	<sd>He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled
but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.</sp>
	<sd>Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic
	beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Threepio!
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- SAND PIT -- ROCK MESA -- DAY.</setting>
<sd>	Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins
	to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben
	stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half
	buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.
		 Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and
	then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until
	finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the
Sandpeople return.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's
no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
	
		</sp><sd> Artoo makes a beeping sound.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
		</sp><sd> Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little
	Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around
	suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the
	air.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Quickly, son...they're on the move.
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: KENOBI'S DWELLING.</setting>
<sd>	The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but
	still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and
	security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as
	old Ben sits thinking.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a
spice freighter.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your
father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten
involved.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You fought in the Clone Wars?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I wish I'd known him.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a
good friend. Which reminds me...
		</sp><sd> Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
	As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the
	restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
	Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the
	table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle
	with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have
this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He
feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic
crusade like your father did. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for
awhile.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Sure, go ahead.
		</sp><sd> Ben hands Luke the saber.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What is it?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not
as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
		</sp><sd>	 
		 Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out
	about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the
	ceiling.</sd>


<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand
generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice
in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.
		</sp><sd> Luke hasn't really been listening.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> How did my father die?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he
turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi
Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all
but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> The Force?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy
field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us.
It binds the galaxy together.
		</sp><sd> Artoo makes beeping sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little
friend. And where you come from.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I saw part of the message he was...
		</sp><sd> Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful
	young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> I seem to have found it.
		</sp><sd> Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers
	before his eyes.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone
Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in
person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital
to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2
unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.</sp>
	<sd>There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
	Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs
	on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to
Alderaan.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (laughing) Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go
home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like
the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right
now. It's such a long way from here.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> That's your uncle talking.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain
this?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Learn about the Force, Luke.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a
transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> You must do what you feel is right, of course.

<sd>	An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like
	battle station: the Death Star!
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONFERENCE ROOM.</setting>
<sd>	Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black
	conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around
	the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is
	speaking.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TAGGE</speaker> Until this battle station is fully operational we are
vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more
dangerous than you realize.
		</sp><sd> The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>MOTTI</speaker> Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle
station!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TAGGE</speaker> The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial
Senate as long as....
		</sp><sd> Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut
	short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial
	outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,
	The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow
	before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place
	at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council
permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept
away.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TAGGE</speaker> That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> The regional governors now have direct control over
territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this
battle station.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TAGGE</speaker> And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a
complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however
unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MOTTI</speaker> Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a
useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This
station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use
it!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to
the power of the Force.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MOTTI</speaker> Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure
up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the
Rebel's hidden fort...
		</sp><sd> Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's
	spell.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> I find your lack of faith disturbing.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> Enough of this! Vader, release him!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> As you wish.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is
operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting
anything this big before.
		</sp><sd> Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are
side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only
Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they
sold them to. And that would lead them home!

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any
trouble.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I heartily agree with you sir.</sp>
	<sd>Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the
	creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
		</sd><sd> Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall-
	savage-looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey
	with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a
	fur-covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
	Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,
	and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a
	sight to behold.
</sd>		 <sd>Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times
	during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets
	out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit
	disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between
	Ben and the giant Wookiee.</sd>
		 <sd>>Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips
	his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear
	or whatever.</sd> 
	<sd>A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.</sd>


<sp><speaker>CREATURE</speaker> Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
		</sp><sd> The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore
	the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby
	Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the
	belligerent monstrosity.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker> He doesn't like you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I'm sorry.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker> I don't like you either
		</sp><sd> The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some
	unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young
	adventurer.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker> (continued) Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're
wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I'll be careful than.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker> You'll be dead.
		</sp><sd> The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar
	moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His
	three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind
	Luke.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you
something...
		</sp><sd> A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the
	young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through
	tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking
	liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a
	wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old
	Ben. The bartender panics.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker> No blasters! No blaster!
		</sp><sd> With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to
	life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is
	cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,
	cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off
	his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke,
	shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts
	to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.
	The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a
	respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his
	bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points
	the the Wookiee.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our
needs.

<sd>	Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an
	electronic conversation with another little red astro-droid. A

	stormtroopers in the street.

<sd>	Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking
	instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and
	follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is
	sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years
	old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and
	cocksure.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells
me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Should I have?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve
parsecs!
		</sp><sd> Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with
	obvious misinformation.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (continued) I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local
bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships
now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions
asked.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you
something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have
to sit here and listen...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand
now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Seventeen, huh!
		</sp><sd> Han ponders this for a few moments.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're
ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Ninety-four.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your
handiwork.
		</sp><sd> Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers
	looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some
	questions. The bartender points to the booth.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker> All right, we'll check it out.
		</sp><sd> The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben
	are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This
could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.

<sd>	As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
	with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature
	speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>GREEDO</speaker> Going somewhere, Solo?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your
boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
		</sp><sd> Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding
	the gun on him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>GREEDO</speaker> It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the
chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty
hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you
first.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Yeah, but this time I got the money.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>GREEDO</speaker> If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>GREEDO</speaker> Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who
drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
	
		</sp><sd> Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>GREEDO</speaker> You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Over my dead body.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>GREEDO</speaker> That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for
a long time.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Yes, I'll bet you have.
		</sp><sd> Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of
	light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the
	other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and
	starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins
	as he leaves.

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out,

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I'm not the type to run.

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker> (fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you
disappoint me...why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry
poor Greedo like that...after all we've been through together.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> You sent Greedo to blast me.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker> (mock surprise) Han, why you're the best smuggler in the
business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern
at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those
twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker> Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of
spice...you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I
be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the
first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice,
but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little
extra. I just need some more time.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker> (to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only
doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra,
say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time...but this is it.
If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you
won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short

will slip through your fingers.

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way,
you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed
first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the

on your home planet of Alderaan.

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Don't everyone thank me at once.
		</sp><sd> Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a
	game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along
	a chess-type board.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
		</sp><sd> Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table
	covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the
	table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca
	seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-
	covered arms over his head.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Now be careful, Artoo.
		</sp><sd> Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his
	stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to
	walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's
	face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.
	Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and
	begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (interrupting) Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket
when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let
the Wookiee win.
		</sp><sd> Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems
	frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his
	head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.
	Han watches with a bit of smugness.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You mean it controls your actions?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
		</sp><sd> Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a
	"seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,
	hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of
	the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift
	lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't
	move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,
	then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red
	laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him
	to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good
blaster at your side, kid.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You don't believe in the Force, do you?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've
seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me
believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's
no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
		</sp><sd> Ben smiles quietly
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> I suggest you try it again, Luke.
		</sp><sd> Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his
	eyes.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am
I supposed to fight?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
		</sp><sd> Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker
	into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then
	drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly
	missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits
	Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful
	yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Stretch out with your feelings.
		</sp><sd> Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker
	makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect
	the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original
	position.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> You see, you can do it.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I call it luck. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against
the living? That's something else.
		</sp><sd> Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the
	control panel.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
		</sp><sd> Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

	window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed,
	then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and
	violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them,
	battering the sides of the ship.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor
shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the
charts.
		</sp><sd> The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool
	in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing
	cockpit.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What's going on?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What do you mean? Where is it?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been
totally blown away.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What? How?
		</sp><sd> Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins
	to settle down.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Destroyed...by the Empire!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take
a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
		</sp><sd> A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled
	alarm starts humming.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> There's another ship coming in.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Maybe they know what happened.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> It's an Imperial fighter.

	outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A
	tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit
	window.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> It followed us!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> No. It's a short range fighter.

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> That's no moon! It's a space station.

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> It's too big to be a space station.

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I have a very bad feeling about this.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the

	away toward the gargantuan battle station.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Why are we still moving towards it?

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker> (to Vader) There's no one on board, sir. According to the

sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Did you find any droids?

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker> No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have
jettisoned.

</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself
in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get
past the tractor beam.

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Leave that to me!

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!

<sp><speaker>HAN'S VOICE</speaker> Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- FORWARD BAY -- COMMAND OFFICE.</setting>
<sd>	In a very small command office near the entrance to the
	pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices
	the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>GANTRY OFFICER</speaker> TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TX</speaker> four-one-two, do you copy? 
		</sp><sd> A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and
	waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating
	his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head
	in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed
	look.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>GANTRY OFFICER</speaker> Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what
I can do.
		</sp><sd> As the officer approaches the door, it slides open
	revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a
	momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone-
	chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one
	blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is
	blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and
	the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also
	dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in
sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking
around.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> We found the computer outlet, sir.
		</sp><sd> Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of
	the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it
	carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
	Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial
computer network.
		</sp><sd> Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the
	vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information
	to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor
beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise
location appear on the monitor.
		</sp><sd> The computer monitor flashes readouts.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven
locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to
leave.
		</sp><sd> Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this
trip already.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I want to go with you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But he can...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path
than mine. The Force will be with you...always!
		</sp><sd> Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps
	out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey
	hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in
	agreement.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Boy you said it, Chewie.
		</sp><sd> Han looks at Luke.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Where did you dig up that old fossil?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Ben is a great man.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I didn't hear you give any ideas...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting
for him to pick us up...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Who do you think...
		</sp><sd> Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
	Luke goes over to him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What is it?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her",
and keeps repeating, "She's here."
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, who...who has he found?
		</sp><sd> Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Princess Leia.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> The princess? She's here?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Princess? What's going on?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid
she's scheduled to be terminated.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Oh, no! We've got to do something.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What are you talking about?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've
got to help her.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to
wait right here.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way
back into the detention block?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I'm not going anywhere.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said
you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to
do is stay. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> But they're going to kill her!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Better her than me...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> She's rich.

</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Rich?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the
reward would be...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well more wealth that you can imagine.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You'll get it!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I better!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> You will...

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.

</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> All right.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What's your plan?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
		</sp><sd> Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.
		</sp><sd> Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Okay. Han, you put these on.
		</sp><sd> Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
		</sp><sd> The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face
	as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what
should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Lock the door!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> And hope they don't have blasters.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> That isn't very reassuring.

<sd>	Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches
	the trio.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker> Where are you taking this...thing?
		</sp><sd> Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to
	shut up.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker> I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
		</sp><sd> The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in
	the information. There are only three other troopers in the
	area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the
	alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of
	Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
</sd>		<sd> Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with
	one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Look out! He's loose!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> He's going to pull us all apart.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Go get him!
		</sp><sd> The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and
	Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are
	blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of
	laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser
	gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the
	last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is
	about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink
	system, which is screeching questions about what is going on.
	He quickly checks the computer readout.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold
them here.</sp>
	<sd>Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the
	buzzing comlink.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation
normal.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>INTERCOM VOICE</speaker> What happened?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (getting nervous) Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh,
everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here,
now, thank you. How are you?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>INTERCOM VOICE</speaker> We're sending a squad up.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few
minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>INTERCOM VOICE</speaker> Who is this? What's your operating number?
		</sp><sd> Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We're
going to have company!
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CELL ROW.</setting>
<sd>	Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door
	away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the
	dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is
	now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face.
	Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at
	her with his mouth hanging open.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> (finally) Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?
		</sp><sd> Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue
you. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> You're who?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben
Kenobi.

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> He is here...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
presence of my old master.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> Surely he must be dead by now.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
		</sp><sd> There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> Yes.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>INTERCOM VOICE</speaker> Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in
detention block A A-twenty-three.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> The princess! Put all sections on alert!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

<sd>	An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the

</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Chewie!</sp>
	<sd>Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Get behind me! Get behind me!
		</sp><sd> A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door
	through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
</sd>		<sd> Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke
	and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up
	with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Can't get out that way.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (sarcastically) Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your
Highness.
		</sp><sd> Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as
	they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their
	way down the corridor.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> (over comlink) Yes sir?

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell
bay?...What was that? I didn't copy!

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN BAY GANTRY -- CONTROL TOWER.</setting>
<sd>	Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and
	whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink
	transmitter.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other
information on your level is restricted.
		</sp><sd> Someone begins banging on the door.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER VOICE</speaker> Open up in there!

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Oh, no!
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DETENTION CORRIDOR.</setting>
<sd>	Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as
	they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca
	are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far
	and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke
	fills the narrow cell corridor.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> There isn't any other way out.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a
plan for getting out?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (pointing to Luke) He's the brains, sweetheart.
		</sp><sd> Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Well, I didn't...
		</sp><sd> The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in
	the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What the hell are you doing?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise
guy.
		</sp><sd> She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca
	look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and
	says something.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get
in there and don't worry about it.
		</sp><sd> Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the
	tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their
	way toward the opening.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to
like her. Get in there!
		</sp><sd> Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han
	fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover,
	then slides into the chute himself and is gone.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.</setting>
<sd>	Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.
	Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds
	a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't budge.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful
idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of
here! Get away from there...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> No! wait!
		</sp><sd> Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The
	laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.
	Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes
	almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a
	rather grim look on her face.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically
sealed!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control
until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long
to figure out what happened to us.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> It could be worst...
		</sp><sd> A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the
	murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins
	to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols
	drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> It's worst.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> There's something alive in here!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> That's your imagination.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Help!
		</sp><sd> Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Luke! Luke! Luke!
		</sp><sd> Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air
	and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around
	his throat.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Luke!
		</sp><sd> Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Where?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Anywhere! Oh!!
		</sp><sd> Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the
	muck by the slimy tentacle.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Luke! Luke!
		</sp><sd> Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and
	move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.
	Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls
	in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly
	bobs to the surface.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Grab him!
		</sp><sd> Luke seems to be released by the thing.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> What happened?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> I've got a very bad feeling about this.
		</sp><sd> Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble
	and edge toward the Rebels.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> The walls are moving!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.
		</sp><sd> They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
	walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant
	trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Wait a minute!
		</sp><sd> Luke pulls out his comlink.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?
</sp>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN GANTRY -- COMMAND OFFICE.</setting>
<sd>	A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for
	See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is
	sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio
	are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and
	the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four
	armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIRST TROOPER</speaker> Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to him!
Look there!
		</sp><sd> A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door
	slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo
	follows his bronze companion out into the office.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you
hurry, you might catch them.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>FIRST OFFICER</speaker> (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard.
		</sp><sd> The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to
	watch over the command office.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> (to Artoo) Come on!
		</sp><sd> The guard aims a blaster at them.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my
counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to
maintenance.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker> All right.

	hurries out the door.

Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws.
Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and
popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See

	tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the
	first crushing pressure against her body.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! (to

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (to Chewie) Where are you going?

<sp><speaker>SECOND TROOPER</speaker> Maybe it's another drill.

	with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear
	something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force,
	Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway.

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Nice! Come on!

	Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are
	taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIRST TROOPER</speaker> It's them! Blast them!
		</sp><sd> Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and
	charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the
	stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down
	the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship!

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Where are you going? Come back!

	furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running the
	other way also.

<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- SUBHALLWAY.</setting>
<sd>	Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a
	narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They
	quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an
	open hatchway.
</sd>

</scene>
<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CENTRAL CORE SHAFT.</setting>
<sd>	Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that
	spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The
	bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke
	almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end
	of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and
	pulls him back.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn.
		</sp><sd> Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby
	reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the
	advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that
	pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them
	precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.
	Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> There's no lock!
		</sp><sd> Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> That oughta hold it for a while.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends
the bridge.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Oh, I think I just blasted it.
		</sp><sd> Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the
	stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making
	ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> They're coming through!
		</sp><sd> Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when
	laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol
	at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across
	the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops
	appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and
	grabs at his chest.
</sd>		<sd> Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by
	Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move
	back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Here, hold this.
		</sp><sd> Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility
	belt. It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a
	bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with
	the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper
	appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.
	Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of
	more troops.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Here they come!
		</sp><sd> Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and
	he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge
	and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on
	the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in
	his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the
	lips. Luke is very surprised.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> For luck!
		</sp><sd> Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss
	to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as
	Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the
	stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at
	the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into
	the tiny subhallway.

	race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage

	before the doors slam shut.

<scene><setting>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY.</setting>
<sd>	Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar
	where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar,
	Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten
	feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and
	steps slowly forward.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The
circle is now complete.
		</sp><sd> Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical
	offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive
	stance.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> Only a master of evil, Darth.
		</sp><sd> The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few
	moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right
	moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,
	as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He
	shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. 
</sd>		<sd> Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked
	by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke
	by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's
	blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark
	Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The
	two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with
	laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker> Your powers are weak, old man.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker> You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more
powerful than you can possibly imagine.

</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What kept you?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> We ran into some old friends.

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Is the ship all right?

<sd>	Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit

	Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of
	The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his
	group's vantage point.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Look!

</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Now's our chance! Go!</sp>
	<sd>They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops
	charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader
	takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings his
	mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to deflect
	the blow and swiftly turns around.
		</sd><sd> The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts
	his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene
	look on his face.
</sd>		<sd> Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's
	cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.
	Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty
	cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the
	robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts
	for him. Aghast, he yells out.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> No!
		</sp><sd> The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.
	The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium
	Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their
	fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances
	toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> (to Luke) Come on!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> Come on! Luke, its too late!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Blast the door! Kid!
		</sp><sd> Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it
	explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge
	forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close
	behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the
	docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his
	onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,
	as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He
	fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN'S VOICE</speaker> Run, Luke! Run!

	turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the
	troopers and races into the ship.

<sd>	The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up

</sd>

<sp><speaker>WILLARD</speaker> (holding Leia) You're safe! We had feared the worst.

<sp><speaker>WILLARD</speaker> When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were...
lost along with your father.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle
station has surely tracked us here (looking pointedly to Han). It's
the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the
information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope.

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker> Yes.

<sp><speaker>DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE</speaker> We are approaching the planet Yavin. The

<scene><setting>INTERIOR: MASSASSI -- WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA.</setting>
<sd>	Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia
	and several other senators are to one side of the giant
	readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,
	navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is
	listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and
	Chewbacca are standing near the back.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODONNA</speaker> The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a
firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed
around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be
able to penetrate the outer defense.
		</sp><sd> Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties,
	stands and addresses Dodonna.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>GOLD LEADER</speaker> Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub
fighters going to be against that?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DODONNA</speaker> Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to
be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the
plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the
battle station.
		</sp><sd> Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping
	sounds, and turns his head from right to left.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODONNA</speaker> The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver
straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The
target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust
port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the
reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should
destroy the station.
		</sp><sd> A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODONNA</speaker> Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is
ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

	about sixteen years old.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>WEDGE</speaker> That's impossible, even for a computer.

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with
this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to
stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty
good in a fight. I could use you.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> (getting angry) Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You
know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a
good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides,
attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like
suicide.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's
what you're best at, isn't it?
		</sp><sd> Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker> Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you!

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his
mind. 
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker> He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I only wish Ben were here.
		</sp><sd> Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
	heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
	his arm.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here...are you going
out with us?!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got
some stories to tell...
		</sp><sd> Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
	behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
	leader.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>RED LEADER</speaker> Are you...Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the
Incom T-sixty-five?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
		</sp><sd> Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of
	his fighter.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>RED LEADER</speaker> I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a
great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's
skill, you'll do better than all right.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Thank you, sir. I'll try.
		</sp><sd> Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories
when we come back. All right?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker> (going off) You did, all right. It's going to be like old
times, Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!
		</sp><sd> Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
	his ship.
</sd>		<sd> As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek,
	deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft,
	points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on
	the back of the fighter.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF</speaker> This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new
one?
</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker> Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a
lot together. (to Artoo) You okay, Artoo?
		</sp><sd> The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of
	the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps
	that he is fine.
</sd>		<sd> Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an
	his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive
	hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner
	into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo
	beeps good-bye.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF</speaker> Okay, easy she goes!
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.
		</sp><sd> Artoo beeps in agreement.
</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker> You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
		</sp><sd> Artoo whistles his reply.
</sd>		<sd> All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
	The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the
	pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The hum
	of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice
	of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are
	disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit
	shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,
	holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace
	of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

	march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From
	one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired
	Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an
	equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the
	whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other
	dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is
	dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
	She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He
	winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is
	moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops,
	who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with
	happiness.</sd>
