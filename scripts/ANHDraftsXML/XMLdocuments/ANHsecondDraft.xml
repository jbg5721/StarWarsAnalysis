<sd>FADE IN:</sd>


<scene n="1"><setting>SPACE</setting>

<sd>A vast sea of stars is broken as the warm, amber surface
		of the planet, UTAPAU, emerges from a total eclipse.  Five 
		small moons slowly drift into view from the far side of 
		the planet.  The MAIN TITLE is followed by a ROLL-UP:</sd>

<sd>The REPUBLIC GALACTICA is dead.  Ruthless
	trader barons, driven by greed and the 
	lust for power, have replaced enlightenment 
	with oppression, and "rule by the people" 
	with the FIRST GALACTIC EMPIRE.</sd>

<sd>Until the tragic Holy Rebellion of "06", 
	the respected JEDI BENDU OF ASHLA were the 
	most powerful warriors in the Universe.  
	For a hundred thousand years, generations 
	of Jedi Bendu knights learned the ways of 
	the mysterious FORCE OF OTHERS, and acted 
	as the guardians of peace and justice in 
	the REPUBLIC.  Now these legendary warriors 
	are all but extinct.  One by one they have 
	been hunted down and destroyed by a fero-
	cious rival sect of mercenary warriors:  
	THE BLACK KNIGHTS OF THE SITH.</sd>

<sd>It is a period of civil wars.  The EMPIRE 
	is crumbling into lawless barbarism through-
	out the million worlds of the galaxy. From 
	the celestial equator to the farthest 
	reaches of the GREAT RIFT, seventy small 
	solar systems have united in a common war 
	against the tyranny of the Empire.  Under 
	the command of a mighty Jedi warrior known 
	as THE STARKILLER, the REBEL ALLIANCE has 
	won a crushing victory over the deadly 
	Imperial Star Fleet.  The Empire knows that 
	one more such defeat will bring a thousand 
	more solar systems into the rebellion, and 
	Imperial control of the Outlands could be 
	lost forever...</sd>

<sd>A tiny silver space craft races from behind one of the
		lifeless Utapau moons.  The small rebel spacefighter is
		being chased by four giant Imperial stardestroyers. Hun-
		dreds of deadly laser bolts streak from the Imperial
		warships as they dive on the smaller craft.</sd>

<sd>Every few moments, the little rebel ship returns the fire, 
		until one of the Imperial battlewagons explodes, causing 
		it to fall out of formation.  The three remaining star-
		destroyers continue the pursuit.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="2"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - LASER GUN TURRET</setting>

<sd>The two elaborate laser gun turrets belch a smoky exhaust
		as the gun crews, wearing heat-protective suits, goggles
		and breath masks, cheer and congratulate each other on the 
		direct hit.  The gunnery CHIEF finishes speaking into his 
		helmet "com-link", and yells to the crew.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
		I don't know what you boys are 
		so cheery about; there are still 
		three more out there.</sp>

<sd>The crews snap-to, and turn back to their giant guns. Sev-
		eral stubby, three-legged ROBOTS scurry to and fro, bring-
		ing equipment, and repairing damage to sections of the 
		turrets.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="3"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY</setting>

<sd>The chaos of battle echoes through the narrow, main passage-
		way of the starfighter.  An explosion rocks the ship, and 
		two construction robots, ARTOO DETOO (R2-D2) and SEE THREEPIO 
		(C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, 
		bouncing passageway.  Both robots are old and battered.  
		Artoo is a short (36 inches), claw-armed, tri-ped.  His face 
		is a mass of computer lights, surrounding a radar eye.  
		Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
		human proportions.  He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
		surface of an "Art Deco" design.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Artoo, my friend, this is madness!  
		If this keeps up, we're going to 
		be destroyed.  I'm afraid I'm still 
		not accustomed to space travel...  
		What are we to do?</sp>

<sd>The little dwarf robot makes a series of electronic sounds 
		that only a robot could understand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Relax?!?...What do you mean we're 
		in no immediate danger??!  You're 
		faulty, this is madness!</sp>

<sd>Artoo gives his tall companion a sheepish computer blink
		and starts off down the hallway. .</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Artoo Detoo, wait!  Wait a 
		minute.</sp>

<sd>Threepio climbs through a hatch and starts after Artoo.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="4"><setting>EXT. SPACE BATTLE</setting>

<sd>One of the giant Imperial Stardestroyers breaks formation
		and surges ahead of the others, closing on the tiny rebel
		space craft.  The main battery of laser cannons on the
		huge Imperial warship directs an overwhelming concentra-
		tion or laser fire at the main solar fin on the rebel ship.  
		Finally it disintegrates, creating a spectacular heavenly 
		display.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="5"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - POWER SECTION</setting>

<sd>A sudden pressure change sucks equipment and debris through 
		the power section of the spacefighter.  Alarms are sound-
		ing everywhere.  The spaceship shudders under the impact 
		of the Imperial barrage.  Artoo and Threepio are blown, 
		slipping and sliding across the hallway floor into a stack 
		of freight canisters.  The lanky Threepio becomes lodged 
		under a computer console.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I'm dead!...I told you this 
		would happen.  Artoo, I can't 
		move.</sp>

<sd>Little Artoo waddles over to his trapped companion.  He
		clears away several mangled canisters and climbs under the 
		sparking and smoking computer.  He is chattering away in 
		an elaborate combination of whistles, beeps and clicks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Oh my, I think something is 
		melting.  Artoo Detoo, this is 
		all your fault...I should have 
		known better than to listen to 
		a half-pint thermo-astronic 
		capulary dehousing - assister.  
		You're truly faulty.</sp>

<sd>Artoo counters with a rather angry rebuttal as he struggles 
		to pull the larger robot free from the small leg space under 
		the computer console.  Two MEN hurriedly enter the power 
		station and begin checking the damage.  The robots can only 
		see the humans' legs as they pass to and fro in front of 
		the desk-like console; but they recognize the voice of their 
		captain: DEAK STARKILLER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Shhh, it's the captain...</sp>

<sd>The captain's FIRST OFFICER pops his head under the console 
		and sees Artoo straining to free Threepio.  The little 
		robot stops.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		Well, Hello!  Are you boys all 
		right?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Yes sir, I'll be out in a minute.  
		No damage that I can tell. Sorry 
		to be of trouble, sir...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		As you were.</sp>

<sd>Artoo goes back to his pulling and pushing as the officer
		again becomes a pair of legs, and is joined by the sturdier 
		legs of Captain Starkiller.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		There's a C-3 unit jammed under 
		the console, but no damage, sir.</sp>

<sd>Artoo uses one of his claw arms to cut away a small metal
		beam bent around Threepio's shoulder.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		The solar activators are burned 
		out.  The shields are down.  
		They'll be boarding in no time.  
		There is a Sith knight among 
		them.  I can feel his para-force.  
		Hurry, secure your assault posi-
		tions.  The BOGAN force is strong 
		with the enemy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		Yes sir, the men are ready.</sp>

<sd>The officer bows low and hurries out of the smoldering cham-
		ber.  Artoo stops his work, and the robots quietly watch 
		Deak's legs as he paces the room.  He stands for a few mo-
		ments in meditation.  The two mechanical men suddenly feel 
		as if they are intruding, and every little creak and noise 
		becomes an embarrassment.  A VOICE from another part of the 
		ship yells out to the captain, and he rushes out of the room.  
		Threepio breathes a sigh of relief.</sd>

<sp>  THREEPIO
		I think there will be no es-
		cape for the captain this time...</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="6"><setting>EXT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER</setting>

<sd>The smoldering silver rebel craft is quickly surrounded by 
		the three giant Imperial warships.  One of the huge star-
		destroyers moves into orbit just above the helpless rebel 
		spacefighter.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="7"><setting>INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>An awesome array of lighted panels and computer monitors are 
		reflected in the polished black helmets of six Imperial 
		master-pilots.  A fifth-ranked General of the Fleet sits in 
		a rotating chair suspended from the cabin ceiling, watching 
		the chief pilot maneuver the huge warship above the tiny 
		rebel spacefighter.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF PILOT</speaker>
		That's as close as I dare take 
		her.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
(into intercom)
		We are in position...stand by.  
		Remember, Lord Vader wants as 
		many of them taken alive as is 
		possible.  There will be no 
		slaughter.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="8"><setting>EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER - UNDERBELLY</setting>

<sd>The huge gray underbelly of the Imperial warship hovers less 
		than twenty feet above the rebel spacefighter.</sd>

<sd>A small hatch near one of the complex antenna groupings
		silently slides open.  With fascist precision, ten storm-
		troopers wearing ominous armored spacesuits drop onto the 
		top of the disabled rebel craft. A burly sergeant aims 
		his powerful laser pistol at the silver hull.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="9"><setting>INT. REBEL STAR FIGHTER - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>A tremendous blast opens up a hole six feet wide in the
		side of the main passageway, sucking equipment and debris
		into the vacuum of space.  Three fearsome stormtroopers
		armed with chrome multi-laser rifles make their way through 
		the smoking debris into the padded hallway.  The SERGEANT 
		and four more armored troopers quickly follow.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SERGEANT</speaker>
		Use your blades!  There's too 
		much risk of blaster ricochet 
		in these cramped quarters.</sp>

<sd>The troops sling the rifles over their shoulders and take
		a small baton from their belts, which instantly ignites
		into a long glowing laser sword.</sd>

<sd>At the far end of the passageway, a door swings wide reveal-
		ing a rebel warrior wearing a breath mask and dressed in 
		the distinctive uniform of an AQUILLIAN RANGER.  A long, 
		deadly laser sword glows in his right hand, while several 
		chrome ping-pong sized balls magically appear in his left.  
		Tiny antenna project from the chrome balls, and before the 
		stormtroopers can raise their weapons, the balls fly out 
		of the ranger's hand.  One of the balls stops in the middle 
		of the troops and explodes.  Three other balls shoot through 
		the hole ripped in the side of the ship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="10"><setting>  EXT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER - UNDERBELLY</setting>

<sd>Six armored stormtroopers are assembled on the sleek silver 
		hull of the rebel spacefighter.  The three chrome balls fly 
		out of the rebel craft just as several more troops drop from 
		the hatch of the Imperial stardestroyer.  One or the seeker-
		bombs explodes among the assembled troops, flinging most of 
		them into the vastness of space.  The two remaining bombs 
		rocket toward the open hatch of the Imperial warship.  One 
		of the surviving stormtroopers, clinging to the rebel craft, 
		yells into his helmet intercom as he aims a laser pistol at 
		the tiny chrome projectiles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker>
		Seekers!  Seekers!  Close the 
		hatches!!</sp>

<sd>A blast from the laser pistol hits one of the balls, and
		it explodes harmlessly outside the stardestroyer.  The
		second seeker bomb races into the stardestroyer, just as
		the hatch slides closed.  A muffled explosion is heard in-
		side the huge spacecraft.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="11"><setting>  INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>The Aquillian ranger charges what's left of the storm-
		troopers.  He swings his glowing laser sword high over his 
		head; but before he can bring the deadly blade down on a 
		victim, four more troops enter the ship and assail the 
		ranger.  He puts up a good fight, but soon falls under the 
		superior odds.  A half dozen more armored stormtroopers 
		enter the damaged ship and cautiously make their way down 
		the narrow hallway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="12"><setting>  INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>Smoke fills the crowded cockpit of the rebel starship. The 
		pilot struggles to remove a wounded comrade as an exhausted 
		Aquillian RANGER enters and bows before Deak Starkiller.  
		The young captain's face is covered by a small, ornate face 
		mask, but he appears to be about twenty-five years old. He 
		is wearing the loose-fitting robes of a Jedi knight.</sd>

<sp><speaker>RANGER</speaker>
		The Bogan force is too strong 
		upon us.  Our spirit is broken.</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		You must rally the men, fight 
		off your despair.  The force of 
		others is still with us...</sp>

<sp><speaker>RANGER</speaker>
		Clieg is dead.  They're blasting 
		the lifepods before we can clear 
		the ship.  We're trapped...</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		Then we must make this treachery 
		costly for them.  Return to your 
		station.</sp>

<sd>The ranger bows low before the Jedi starcaptain, and rushes 
		out of the cockpit.  The pilot has returned to his seat in 
		front of the ship's main control board.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEAK (CONT'D)</speaker>
		What's the power now?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT (TYREE)</speaker>
		It's up to five point nine; but 
		we'll need a lot more to ignite 
		the engines...There just isn't 
		enough time...</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		Keep at it.I'm going aft.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT (TYREE)</speaker>
		But what about your father. He 
		must have the KIBER Crystal if 
		Ogana Major is to survive.  He 
		won't be able to hold out against 
		the Imperial siege much longer.
		The risk was too great.  We'll 
		never be able to make contact 
		with Luke now.  We've lost every-
		thing.  We should never...</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		You're feeling the Bogan's despair.
		Be strong, Tyree, drive it from 
		your thoughts.  Luke is father's 
		only hope...maybe there is still 
		a slim chance we might salvage 
		things.</sp>

<sd>He moves to the computer bank, and speaks into the intercom.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEAK (CONT'D)</speaker>
		All R-2 units stand by for new 
		prime directive programming...</sp>

<sd>He turns back to the pilot for a moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEAK (CONT'D)</speaker>
		What's the R-2 scramble code?</sp>

<sp><speaker>Pilot (TYREE)</speaker>
		"Tan-takk RS-411".  Do you think 
		one of them might get through?</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		I'm afraid the chances of an R-2
		unit finding Luke down there are 
		much better than Luke's chances 
		of getting back to father...R-2 
		units compute as follows: Scramble 
		code, tan-takk RS-411.  Prime 
		directive - contact code "Angel 
		blue".  Seek OWEN LARS at or near 
		position: 321-DC-28.  Relay the 
		following transcription:</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="13"><setting>  INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - MAIN HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>Little Artoo stands ridged in the middle of the smoke-filled 
		passageway.  Threepio runs awkwardly toward the tiny robot 
		from a large hatchway at one end of the corridor.  Artoo's 
		computer face blinks wildly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		We're cut off.  They're coming 
		from that direction.  I heard 
		them.  Come on, we'll have to go 
		back the way we came.</sp>

<sd>Artoo lets out a long musical whistle, but doesn't move.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Wait!?? They'll be here in mo-
		ments!  I have no intention of 
		getting sent to the spice mines 
		of KESSAL, or smashed into... 
		what?!  A new prime directive!??!  
		Oh no!  Not at a time like this!  
		How much longer?</sp>

<sd>The muted sounds of grinding and crushing get louder until 
		a dozen Imperial stormtroopers, wearing spooky-looking armor, 
		enter the passageway.  They arrange themselves geometrically, 
		their movements synchronized, as they move stealthily through 
		the unusually wide corridor.  Threepio grabs his little part-
		ner and struggles to drag him into the shadows of an emer-
		gency ventilator system.  Hard and weary, the troops advance 
		-- their glowing laser swords held at ready.  Suddenly, 
		directly in back of the stormtroopers, about ten feet away, 
		the imposing young Jedi, Deak Starkiller, steps from behind 
		the open hatch.</sd>

<sd>His chrome laser pistol still rests in its holster; but his 
		laser sword sparks to life with a sharp hum.  One of the 
		troopers senses his presence and turns freezing momentarily.  
		The rest of the troops turn a second later, almost as a re-
		flex action.  A slow grim smile creeps across Deak's face, 
		as the troops realize they are outmatched.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker>
		He's a Jedi.  Use your blasters!</sp>

<sd>Six troopers who are carrying their chrome laser rifles at 
		the ready start to step forward and raise their weapons.  
		Deak is quicker.  In one amazing movement, he spins around, 
		replacing his laser sword to his belt, and draws his deadly 
		laser pistol, blasting out four shots that rip through the 
		soldiers.  In a few moments, the entire passageway blazes 
		with laser fire.  Laser bolts ricochet in wild random pat-
		terns, creating small explosions and finally a small hole in 
		the wall, which sucks debris and stormtroopers into space, 
		until finally it is plugged by a large supply canister.</sd>

<sd>Artoo and Threepio are plummeted by loose equipment and de-
		bris.  Threepio attempts to cover his head.  Artoo pulls a 
		grate off the vent system and starts to enter the dark shaft.  
		Threepio clings to a side rail for dear life as debris and 
		laser bolts fly past him.  Artoo beeps to his terrified com-
		panion.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		No more adventures!  I'm not 
		going in there.  No!  Never!</sp>

<sd>Artoo disappears down the ominous shaft.  He leaves his friend 
		with a few parting whistles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
		you overweight glob of grease!  I 
		simply think you are going the wrong 
		way.</sp>

<sd>Threepio peers into the gloom of the vent shaft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Hello?!?  Artoo?...</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="14"><setting>  INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - COCKPIT CORRIDOR</setting>

<sd>Stormtroopers scatter and run down an adjoining passageway; 
		others duck behind storage lockers.</sd>

<sd>Multiple laser fire rips through several stormtroopers who 
		scream and stagger from the smoke, holding shattered arms 
		and faces.  Deak and two Aquillian rangers back into a 
		sealed corridor at the far end of the passageway.  Deak's 
		gun jams, and the two rangers are cut down behind him. The 
		young Jedi ignites his glowing red laser sword and begins 
		swinging.  Stormtroopers are cut down right and left, un-
		til they flee the corridor in panic, firing wildly as they 
		stumble over canisters to escape.</sd>

<sd>Suddenly several of the panic-stricken troopers who had fled 
		down a sub-hallway are back into the cockpit area, more 
		afraid of what's down the sub-hallway than the deadly Jedi's 
		blade.  Troopers still fleeing the area crash into those re-
		turning.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker>
		The Sith Knight...Lord Vader is 
		coming.  Go back.  Go back!</sp>

<sd>A new courage, or greater fear, seizes the troops and they 
		turn on Deak again and renew the attack.  The troops scram-
		ble away from the sub-hallway entrance, as something un-
		speakably evil and terrifying approaches the cabin.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="15"><setting>  INT. REBEL STARFIGHTER - SUB-HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>The tall, gleaming Threepio rushes through several low, nar-
		row corridors, yelling at Artoo, who races along as fast as 
		his stubby mechanical feet will carry him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Wait!  Wait a minute.  I'm coming.
		...Would you mind telling me where
		you are off to?</sp>

<sd>Artoo throws a short beep over his shoulder.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
Leaving?!  Leaving where?  Don't 
		be ridiculous, that's desertion!  
		I order you to stop.  Did you 
		hear me?  Stop!</sp>

<sd>Artoo continues on, countering with a frenzy of electronic 
		whistles and twangs.</sd>

<sp>
	THREEPIO (CONT'D)
		What new prime directive?  Why 
		didn't I receive it?  
		What's so important that I'm 
		not to be trusted?  I don't 
		believe you.  I think you're 
		rattled.</sp>

<sd>Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.  
		He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
		begins to flash.  The stubby, dwarf-robot works his way 
		into the cramped four-man pod.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Hey!  What are you doing?  You 
		can't use that!...It's restricted.  
		You're not permitted in there; 
		you'll be de-activated for sure.  
		The situation is not that des-
		perate!  Now come out of there 
		before someone sees you.</sp>

<sd>A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
		through the narrow sub-hallway.  Flames lick at the two ro-
		bots.  After a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the 
		lanky bronze Threepio jumps into the lifepod.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I think I'm going to regret this; 
		but my prime directive IS preser-
		vation.</sp>

<sd>The safety door snaps shut, and with the thunder of explod-
		ing latches, the tiny lifepod ejects from the disabled star-
		fighter.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="16"><setting>  INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terri-
		fied robots speeds away from the stricken rebel spacecraft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF PILOT</speaker>
		There goes another one.  Look.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
		Hold your fire.  No lifeforms.
		It must have short-circuited.</sp>

<sd>The captain gets a message on his headset.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Yes...Yes...He's on his way 
		down now...No. Good, excellent.
		I'll relay it.
(he turns to
the pilots)
		The ship is ours!</sp>

<sd>The pilots cheer and an excited murmur rushes throughout
		the ship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="17"><setting>  EXT. SKY OVER UTAPAU - LIFEPOD</setting>

<sd>The reddish-yellow mass of Utapau seems to engulf the tiny 
		lifepod containing the two robots.  The grouping of star-
		destroyers grows smaller as the pod descends toward the 
		planet.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		That's funny, the damage 
		doesn't look as bad from out 
		here.  Are you sure this thing 
		is safe?</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="18"><setting>  INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - COCKPIT CORRIDOR</setting>

<sd>Deak Starkiller cuts down several troops who make a fren-
		zied, suicidal charge with laser swords.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPS</speaker>
		The Bogan!  The Bogan!</sp>

<sd>They are no match for the incredibly agile young Jedi.  For 
		an eerie moment, all is deathly quiet as a huge darker figure 
		appears in the sub-hallway.  The remaining stormtroopers bow 
		low toward the doorway.  An awesome, seven-foot BLACK KNIGHT 
		OF THE SITH makes his way into the blinding light of the cock-
		pit area.  This is LORD DARTH VADER, right hand to the MASTER 
		OF THE SITH.  His sinister face is partially obscured by his 
		flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which are in 
		sharp contrast to the fascist white armored suits of the 
		Imperial stormtroopers.  The troops instinctively back away 
		from the imposing warrior.</sd>

<sd>Deak Starkiller stands firm; a new look of resolve sweeps		
		across his tired face.  The smoky room is deathly quiet, ex-
		cept for the occasional snapping and popping of burning 
		electrical circuits in the cockpit's sophisticated control 
		panel.</sd>

<sd>As the Black Knight enters the corridor, the few surviving 
		troopers scramble into the sub-hallway.  Lord Vader speaks 
		in an oddly filtered voice through his complex breathing 
		mask.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		At last we meet!</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEAK</speaker>
		With so much commotion, I 
		expected your master, not 
		merely a servant.</sp>

<sd>Vader is angered by this remark.  Taking a deep breath, he 
		raises his arms and every object that isn't bolted down is 
		picked up by an invisible force and hurled at the young 
		Jedi.  When the objects reach about two feet of Deak, they 
		are deflected by an invisible shield which surrounds him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEAK (CONT'D)</speaker>
		The Bogan is strong with you; 
		but not nearly strong enough.  
		I'm afraid you�ll have to use 
		your weapon, if you're able!</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		I am Lord Darth Vader, first 
		Knight of the Sith, and right

		Espaa Valorum, the Master of

<sd>The fearsome dark knight ignites his laser sword and takes 
		a defensive stance.  The two galactic warriors stand per-
		fectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and 
		waiting for the right moment.  Deak seems to be under in-
		creasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight 
		were being placed upon him.  He shakes his head and blink-
		ing, tries to clear his eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Your powers are weak...</sp>

<sd>Deak makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
		by a lightning movement of the SITH.  A second masterful 
		slash-stroke by Deak is again blocked by his evil opponent.</sd>

<sd>They stand motionless for a few moments, with laser swords 
		locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.  Another 
		of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered.  Deak stum-
		bles back against a wall.  Slowly Deak is forced to his 
		knees as all his energy is drained from his being. Finally, 
		he collapses in a heap.  The sinister knight lets out a 
		horrible, shrieking laugh, as stormtroopers rush in with 
		restraining poles, followed by a braided and flashy Imperial 
		commander.  Deak's arms and legs are pinned to the wall.
		He struggles with his bonds.</sd>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
		So, we got him.  Your para-
		force is strong indeed.  The 
		Emperor will be pleased. Why, 
		he's just a boy!</sp>

<sd>An Imperial officer takes a gold medallion from around the 
		young Jedi's neck.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		The Starkiller!</sp>

<sd>A murmur of astonishment races throughout the troops.</sd>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
		Impossible!  He would have to 
		be over three hundred years old.
		How could this Jedi possibly be 
		the Starkiller?</sp>

<sd>The great Black Knight studies the golden crest, and then
		stares into the eyes of the fuming Jedi.  Vader has a visi-
		ble dislike of the commander.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		This is another of his sons.</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
		Your master said he'd killed them 
		all...And why is he wearing his 
		father's crest?</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		His father must be dead.  The 
		Starkiller would never give this 
		up if he were alive...It possesses 
		great power.  This boy must be 
		the last...</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
		"The son of the suns!" The 
		last of the Starkiller line, 
		whom the seer's have said 
		would bring down the Empire.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		It appears we have altered 
		destiny.</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
(to an aid)
		Send word to the Emperor.
		We've captured their "Savior".
		The rebellion is broken. The 
		Starkiller is dead.  Let the 
		attack of Ogana Major begin...</sp>

<sd>The Black Knight takes a restraining pole from one of the
		guards and brutally jabs the young Jedi in the chest.  Deak 
		squirms in pain but does not cry out.  He is struck again.
		An officer approaches the commander.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		Why would he chance running 
		the blockade to come out here 
		in the middle of nowhere.
		There is little on this planet...</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
		An interesting question. Send 
		a platoon of "Tuskens" to the 
		planet surface and have them 
		report anything unusual. Maybe 
		he has friends we should know 
		about...
(turning pointedly
to Vader)
		or perhaps another brother...</sp>

<sd>Vader gives the commander an angry stare and suddenly it
		appears as if the commander can't catch his breath.  The
		commander turns and rushes out of the cabin in great dis-
		tress.  Vader punches Deak one last time.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		You will come to know such suf-
		fering as only the Master of the 
		Bogan Force can provide.  From 
		you he will learn many secrets...</sp>

<sd>Vader throws Deak's head back painfully hard against the
		wall.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER (CONT'D)</speaker>
(to the guards)
		Bind him, and take him to my 
		ship.
(to Deak)
		There is no one to save you now.</sp>

<sd>His frightening laugh rings throughout the starship.</sd>

<scene n="19"><setting>  EXT. PLANET UTAPAU - EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA</setting>

<sd>JUNDLAND, or "No Man's Land" where the rugged desert mesas 
		meet the foreboding dune sea.  The two helpless astro-robots 
		kick up clouds of dust as they leave the lifepod, and clum-
		sily work their way across the desert coastline.  The stubby 
		Artoo struggles desperately to keep up with the long-legged 
		Threepio.  Suddenly, Artoo makes a sharp right turn, and 
		starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas.  
		Threepio stops and yells at him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Where do you think you're going?!?</sp>

<sd>A stream of electronic noises pour forth from the small ro-
		bot.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		...to find Owen Lars?!?  What's 
		that?!?  Just because the boss 
		was looking for his brother 
		doesn't mean WE have to look for 
		him!  That WAS the prime direc-
		tive, but not anymore...Besides, 
		why go that way?  It's so rocky.  
		Why not go this way?  It would 
		be much easier.  How do you KNOW 
		Owen Lars is that way?</sp>

<sd>Artoo continues his electronic babbling.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Don't get technical with me. I 
		think you're going the wrong way.
		I've had just about enough of you!  
		You pragmatic, nearsighted scrap 
		pile.
		I don't believe this "Angel Blue" 
		even exits, but you just go that 
		way.  You'll be malfunctioning 
		within a day.</sp>

<sd>He picks up the tiny robot and tosses him several feet into 
		a large sand dune.  Threepio starts off in the direction 
		of the dune sea.  Artoo struggles to his three, stubby feet 
		and shakes a metallic claw arm at his disappearing ex-partner.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
(over his shoulder)
		...And don't let me catch you 
		following me begging for help --
		because you won t get it!</sp>

<sd>Artoo counters with a few short whistles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Don't call ME a traitor.  My 
		loyalty is impeccable!...You 
		emotion-brained intellectual...</sp>

<sd>Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound.  He turns and trudges 
		off in the opposite direction.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="20"><setting>  EXT. PLANET UTAPAU - DUNE SEA</setting>

<sd>Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a
		dune, only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for end-
		less miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now dis-
		tant rock mesas.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		You little malfunctioning twerp.
		This is all your fault.  You 
		tricked me into going this way, 
		but you'll do no better.</sp>

<sd>He sits in a huff of anger and frustration, knocking the
		sand from his joints.  His plight seems hopeless, when a
		glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object 
		speeding toward him.  The bronze android waves frantically 
		and yells at the approaching transport.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="21"><setting>  EXT. PLANET UTAPAU - ROCK MESA</setting>

<sd>The little Artoo stumbles over several boulders as he strug-
		gles to reach the crest of a rocky mesa.</sd>

<sd>He reaches the top and scans the foreboding desert valley
		below.  Far in the distance, shining in the twin suns like 
		an inviting oasis, stands the settlement of ANCHORHEAD.
		The mechanical runt carries on an electronic conversation 
		with himself as he searches the rugged ground for something.  
		He picks up a large stone in his powerful claw hand, then 
		discards it.  He finds another stone that he is apparently 
		satisfied with, carries it to the edge of the butte, and 
		tosses it over.  The stone slams down the steep side of the 
		mesa, kicking up dust and creating a small avalanche.  He 
		makes some quick calculations, then starts off down the 
		treacherous slope.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="22"><setting>  EXT. PLANET UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON</setting>

<sd>The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
		mist, and the ominous sounds of unearthly creatures fill
		the air.  Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
		canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he
		goes.  He hears a distant, hard metallic sound and stops
		for a moment.  He hears nothing.  He sees nothing moving.  
		Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.</sd>

<sd>In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
		and a small dark figure darts into the shadows.  A little 
		further up the canyon, a slight flicker of light reveals a 
		pair of eyes in the dark recesses, only a few feet from the 
		narrow path.</sd>

<sd>The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail un-
		til suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots 
		out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.  He 
		manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over 
		onto his back.  His bright computer lights flicker off, 
		then on, then off again.  Out of the rocks scurry three 
		MEN, no taller than Artoo.  They holster strange and com-
		plex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot.  They 
		wear grubby cloaks, and their faces are shrouded so that 
		only their yellow eyes can be seen.  They hiss and make 
		odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot to their 
		shoulders, and carry him off down the trail.  The vile little 
		creatures grunt and groan as they struggle with their weighty 
		prize.  They smell horribly, attracting small insects to 
		the dark areas where their mouths and nostrils should be.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="23"><setting>  EXT. ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER</setting>

<sd>Eight dwarfs, or JAWAS, as they're sometimes called, carry 
		Artoo out of the canyon to a huge sandcrawler -- a tank-
		like vehicle the size of a two-story house.</sd>

<sd>They place the robot in a small bin on one side of the
		crawler, and a mechanical arm promptly lifts the bin, dump-
		ing the unconscious Artoo into the back of the giant trac-
		tor.  The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small 
		ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.  
		Several windows light up in the cockpit area toward the 
		front of the crawler followed by the loud scream of power-
		ful engines.  The enormous sandcrawler turns and lumbers 
		off toward the magnificent twin suns, now slowly setting 
		over a distant mountain range.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="24"><setting>  INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA</setting>

<sd>It is dim and dank inside the hold area of the sandcrawler.  
		Artoo lies on a pile of metal scrap, lifepods, rocket parts, 
		and the limbs and dismembered parts of robots.  Artoo's 
		computer lights slowly begin to glow, then they blink on 
		full power.  He makes a few electronic sounds to himself as 
		he tries to figure out what happened, and where he is.  He 
		stumbles around on the scrap heap until he thinks to turn 
		on the small floodlight on his forehead.</sd>

<sd>The narrow beam swings across the rubble and stops on the
		half-buried claw arm of another robot.  Artoo moves over
		to the buried robot and calls to it, but gets no response.  
		He pulls on the arm but it won't budge.  Finally he gives 
		it a good tug and it breaks loose, sending him head over 
		heels.  He sits dazed, holding the severed forearm of a 
		power robot, then lets out a terrifying electronic shriek.  
		The little robot scans the rest of the huge chamber with 
		his headlights and sees a series of grotesquely twisted and 
		maimed astro robots.  The narrow beam comes to rest on a 
		battered, but otherwise whole "common-labor" robot.  The 
		"laborer" makes a move to cover his giant electronic eye, 
		which is extended on a long tube from his box-like body.  
		Little Artoo jumps back in fright.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LABORER</speaker>
		Shut off that light!</sp>

<sd>Artoo is still shaken, but manages a short apology and then 
		shuts off his light.  The laborer robot is barely visible.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LABORER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Is there no peace!?  This is 
		MY chamber, go find yourself 
		another.  Go on...go on!  Get 
		out!</sp>

<sd>Artoo stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the 
		end of the chamber.</sd>

<sd>He enters a large room with a very low ceiling (about four 
		feet high).  In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen 
		or so robots of various shapes and sizes.  Some are engaged 
		in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about.
		In the middle of the group sits a strange, little robot with 
		a large worklight for a head, which illuminates the odd 
		assemblage of mechanical slaves.  A blue "astroconstruction" 
		robot -- somewhat similar to Artoo, only a bit fatter -
		approaches the newcomer and beeps an electronic greeting.
		The two stubby robots exchange electronic analysis of the 
		situation as they waddle toward the group.  A voice of rec-
		ognition calls out from the gloom.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Artoo!  Artoo Detoo!  It's you!</sp>

<sd>A battered and slightly worse-for-wear Threepio scrambles
		up to Artoo on his hands and knees (remember the four foot 
		ceiling) and embraces him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		...they've caught you, too. I'm
		afraid we're doomed!  We're 
		doomed!</sp>

<sd>The blue robot continues on back to the group as the two
		old companions huddle in a hollow of scrap metal.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		We've landed on one of the 
		OUTLAND DARK PLANETS!  There is 
		no hope for us now.  These Jawa's 
		aren't traders, they're metalmen.
		They'll melt us down.  I'm not 
		useful like you, they'll scrap me 
		for sure.</sp>

<sd>Artoo makes a short electronic reply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		You're right.  I should not have 
		ignored your prime directive.
		But it's a little late now...
		Wait, we're stopping!</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="25"><setting>  EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT</setting>

<sd>The monstrous sandcrawler pulls up to a large outcropping
		of rocks in the trail and grinds to a rumbling stop.</sd>

<sd>Several Jawa's scramble out of the huge vehicle to inspect 
		the boulders blocking the trail.  An argument erupts between 
		one Jawa, in a red habit, and the other hooded dwarfs.  He 
		yells something at the others, then walks off to the side 
		of the trail.  The rest of the little creatures climb back 
		into the giant tank.  The crawler starts with a low hummmmm, 
		slowly moving forward until a loud scraping noise screams 
		from beneath the chassis.  The red-cloaked dwarf climbs on-
		to a nearby rock and yells at the others to stop.  They ig-
		nore him.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="26"><setting>  INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA</setting>

<sd>The scraping sound is haunting as well as deafening.  The
		entire chamber trembles, creating quite a commotion among
		the mechanical men.  At the far end of the long chamber, a 
		bright light suddenly appears, followed by a cacophony of 
		electronic shouts and yells.  The "common labor" robot runs 
		past the confused Artoo and Threepio.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LABORER</speaker>
		We're free!  We're free!</sp>

<sd>Amidst the confusion of the fleeing robots, Artoo and Threepio 
		carefully make their way toward a break in the side of the 
		crawler.  Several Jawas appear at the opening with pistols, 
		but before they can fire, they are knocked over and trampled 
		by the fleeing mechanical men.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="27"><setting>  EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT</setting>

<sd>The sound of yelling Jawas and screaming robots fades in
		the distance as Artoo and Threepio scramble up a narrow ra-
		vine away from the sandcrawler.  They duck into a tiny crev-
		ice in the rock to avoid several fleeing robots, followed 
		by a dozen armed Jawas.  After a few moments they peer out, 
		and seeing that the way is clear, rush off down the winding 
		path.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="28"><setting>  EXT. PLANET UTAPAU - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT</setting>

<sd>A small settlement, consisting of a few run-down blockhouse-
		type buildings, rests against one of the huge rock mesas.  
		The two robots study the sleepy little camp from a bluff 
		some distance away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I don't like it.
		What if there are more Jawa-
		scavengers down there?</sp>

<sd>The runt-like Artoo starts off down the side of the rocky
		bluff.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Wait a minute!It's too 
		dangerous.  We need a plan...</sp>

<sd>Threepio chases his little partner down the slope.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="29"><setting>  EXT. ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - MAIN STREET</setting>

<sd>The dozen or so buildings are bleached white by the two
		Utapau suns.  A harsh and dusty wind blows through the empty 
		streets of the tiny settlement.  A rather frightened Threepio 
		follows his little companion down the foreboding street to-
		ward a low concrete structure that is all but covered by the 
		desert sands.  The rusted hulk of a powerful "landspeeder" 
		(an auto-like transport which travels a few feet above the 
		ground on a magnetic field) lies half-buried to one side of 
		the building.  The two robots cautiously approach the dilapi-
		dated power station.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I don't like this...</sp>

<sd>It is quiet, but for the continual wind.  A dismantled speeder 
		rests in the repair bay of the gas station-like building.  
		There is a sharp dripping sound coming from the speeder. It 
		appears that no one is around.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Greetings!...Greetings.  Is 
		anyone home?
(to Artoo)
		I think you're overheated.
		There is no one here...</sp>

<sd>Out of the gloom of the office behind them, a voice cuts
		through the silence:</sd>

<sp><speaker>VOICE (MECHANIC)</speaker>
		What can I do you for?</sp>

<sd>The robots turn around with a start.  A short, wizened old 
		MECHANIC of sixty or seventy stands before them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MECHANIC (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Who are you with?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Greetings, sir.  I'm See Threepio,
		Human-Cyborg relations.  This is 
		my counterpart, Artoo Detoo. Your 
		kindness would be greatly appre-
		ciated...</sp>

<sd>The old mechanic is a bit suspicious.  An evil look fills
		his eye.  He rubs his grimy, withered hand over Threepio's 
		smooth metal shoulder.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MECHANIC</speaker>
		You're in very good shape for 
		these parts...Where is your 
		master?  You do have a master,
		don't you?</sp>

<sd>Artoo beeps a few signals to his bronze friend.  The old
		mechanic begins to fiddle with the wrench he is holding,
		in the most unsettling way.  Threepio becomes a bit nervous.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I am looking for one Owen Lars.
		We believe him to be of this 
		settlement.  Do you know where 
		we might find him?</sp>

<sd>The mechanic starts dragging a heavy power-pack toward the 
		station.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MECHANIC</speaker>
		Lars!  I should have known...He 
		should know better than to let 
		you travel alone.  He has a place 
		about three measures out of town.
		Due north, you can't miss it. It's 
		the only place out there...</sp>

<sd>Artoo helps the old man with the heavy power pack.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Your kindness is greatly appreciated.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MECHANIC</speaker>
		Any time I can help Lars, I am at 
		his service.  You tell him that.
		Be careful going out there, 
		this ain't good country for 
		you two to be running loose 
		in.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Yes sir, we appreciate your 
		concern.</sp>

<sd>The two robots start down the empty street heading north,
		leaving the old mechanic scratching his head.  The old man 
		passes a sinister-looking, black Imperial speeder half 
		hidden behind a generator as he returns to his gloomy of-
		fice.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MECHANIC</speaker>
		Now there's something "out of

<sd>Artoo and Threepio enter the main courtyard of the Lars

		ing over with foliage from rooftop gardens.  They stop be-
		fore an enormous shaded corridor. BIGGS AND WINDY STARKILLER, 
		twin boys a little over seven years old, run through the 
		long tile walkway to greet the robots.  Yelling and laughing, 
		their tiny footsteps echo throughout the building.  They are 
		quickly followed by OWEN LARS, a bearded, sturdy-burly man 
		in his early fifties and his plump-jolly wife, BERU.  Their 
		beautiful sixteen-year-old daughter, LEIA, stands shyly at 
		the far end of the entry.  The twins run around the robots, 
		jumping and screaming their excitement.  The mechanical men 
		are somewhat befuddled by the dynamic duo, and attempt to 
		ignore them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LARS</speaker>
		Welcome.  May we offer you 
		shelter?  Are you lost, or do 
		you travel with someone?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Greetings.  I am See Threepio,

(to the riotous

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		We have come for the one called

<sd>Owen and Beru are startled at the mention of "Angel Blue".  
		Leia approaches the group, and eyes the robots suspiciously; 
		she turns to her father.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Father, I think they're a trap, 
		sent by an evil Jawa trading lord, 
		or the dark master of the Bogan, 
		or maybe even the Emperor himself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LARS</speaker>
		Leia.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Yes, that's it.  They've inter-
		cepted transmission fragments 
		and are now searching the galaxy 
		for the source.  They don't know 
		the origin, so they have sent 
		these...</sp>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		Leia, please!  Let your father

<sp><speaker>LARS</speaker>
		Who speaks for you?  From what

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>

<sd>Beru's concern at the mention of Deak cannot be contained.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>

<sp><speaker>LARS</speaker>

</scene>
<scene n="33"><setting>  EXT. DESERT RAVINE</setting>

<sd>Alone in a wind-swept canyon stands LUKE STARKILLER, a short, 
		chubby boy about eighteen years old.  He seems frozen in 
		place, a humming laser sword held high over his head.  The 
		twins stop on the ridge overlooking their brother and fall 
		silent.  The robots soon take up position behind them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Is that "Angel Blue"?</sp>

<sd>Biggs turns and gestures to the tall bronze man to be quiet.  
		Suspended at eye level -- about ten feet in front of Luke --
		a chrome baseball covered with antenna hovers slowly in a 
		wide arc.  The ball floats to one side of the youth, then 
		to the other.  Suddenly it makes a lightning swift lunge and 
		stops within a few feet of Luke's face.  Luke doesn't move, 
		and the ball backs off.  It slowly moves behind the boy, 
		then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood-
		red laser beam as it attacks.</sd>

<sd>Luke sparks to life.  With one amazingly swift move, he
		turns and swings his laser sword, deflecting the beam, and 
		losing his balance, tumbles to the desert floor.  The ball 
		shoots straight up in the air about twenty feet, then drops 
		like a rock firing a second laser bolt, which hits the youth 
		square on the seat of his pants.  Luke lets out a painful 
		yell and attempts to scramble to his feet, but is hit several 
		more times before he manages to regain his balance and de-
		flect the bolts.</sd>

<sd>The ball ceases firing, and moves back to its original posi-
		tion.  Luke raises his hand signaling "enough for one day".
		He wearily picks up his things, including the chrome ball, 
		then turns and waves to the small group on the ridge.  The 
		twins run down to greet him.  By the time the cumbersome 
		Artoo and Threepio make it down the slope, Biggs and Windy 
		are climbing all over their big brother.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		"Angel Blue"?...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		"...the skywalker"...</sp>

<sd>The two robots make a short bow before the youth.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		See Threepio, and my counterpart 
		Artoo Detoo.  At your service, sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		You have word of my brother.
		What has happened to him?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I'm sorry, sir; but I am unable 
		to explain the absence of our 
		master.  We only bring his mes-
		sage...</sp>

<sd>Artoo makes a few electronic beeps and whistles; then after 
		a little static, a small (two foot) 3-D hologram of Deak is 
		projected from the face of the robot.  The image is a rain-
		bow of color as it flickers and jiggles in the desert waste-
		land.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEAK'S IMAGE</speaker>
		Whippersnapper, I didn't make 
		it...I'm sorry.  The forces of 
		the Bogan have become strong 
		and deadly...I am lost.  Father 
		is in grave danger.  He needs 
		you and he needs the KIBER CRYSTAL.
		You must find a way to get to 
		Ogana Major on your own.  He is 
		waiting for you there.  Be care-
		ful, though.  Ogana Major is 
		under siege by the Imperial 
		Legions of Alderaan.  You must 
		hurry for the force of the Ashla 
		grows weak, and I don't know how 
		much longer father can hold out.
		The enemy has constructed a power-
		ful weapon to use against him.
		Warn Uncle...</sp>

<sd>An Aquillian officer enters the hologram and interrupts Deak.  
		There is a little static, then the transmission is cut short.  
		A grave concern sweeps over Luke as he contemplates the fate 
		of his brother.  Biggs and Windy are puzzled.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		Who was that?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		That was your brother Deak.  I 
		wish you could see him in person, 
		he is so terrific...I'm afraid 
		you may never see him now.  Run 
		to the house.
		Tell Aunt Beru or Uncle Owen 
		I'm going to be awhile.  Go 
		on now...Take them with you.</sp>

<sd>The boys rush off with the robots in tow, leaving Luke sit-
		ting silently alone.  He picks up some small stones and be-
		gins to toss them at a large boulder.  A chip in the boulder 
		reveals a small shiny fossil.  Luke spots it and goes over 
		to study it.  He takes a small camera out of his bag and 
		photographs it, making some accompanying notations in a small 
		book.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="34"><setting>  INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA</setting>

<sd>Owen Lars and the three boys sit before a table covered with 
		steaming bowls of food.  Biggs and Windy are eating between 
		giggles and horseplay.  Luke has barely touched his dinner.  
		Leia enters from the kitchen with a flask filled with blue 
		milk.  She sits near Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		Where's the thanta sauce?
(yelling into
the other room)
		Honey, where's the thanta 
		sauce?</sp>

<sd>Beru enters carrying a small pitcher.  She gives Owen a
		knowing smile as she slides into her place at the table.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		I never!  I put it right here 
		in front so you'd see it.</sp>

<sd>She hands him a dish, and he grunts an embarrassed reply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Luke, you've hardly touched 
		your dinner.  Have some bum-bum 
		extract.  It's very mild.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
(to Luke)
		The force of the Bogan is strong, 
		and if you don't feel you can 
		make it, you probably won't.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I've never even been past this 
		planet...and I never thought I'd 
		be going alone.
		Suddenly I feel very small --
		and well...desperate.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		How I wish I had the counsel of 
		your father.  Ever since your 
		mother died, we have fallen on 
		doubtful times...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Deak is in trouble.  I should 
		be helping him...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		If your brother is still alive, 
		they will have taken him to the 
		dungeons of ALDERAAN, at the 
		very heart of the Empire.  No 
		one, not even your father in his 
		prime, could help him there.</sp>

<sd>Biggs and Windy have finished eating and are getting restless.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		May we play with the "droids"?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		Take your plates out first.</sp>

<sd>The twins scamper into the kitchen with their dirty dishes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		Your father is getting very old.
		I fear he needs your help more 
		than your brother does, and much 
		more depends on him succeeding.
		If he at last has asked for the 
		Kiber Crystal, his powers must 
		be very weak.  It is a dangerous 
		thing to have loose in the galaxy
		...and you need him, for you are 
		not yet with the FORCE OF OTHERS.
		I have taught you the ways of a 
		skilled warrior, but I am not a 
		Jedi Bendu.  The ways of the 
		spirit you must learn from your 
		father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		But my catalog on the ancients.
		I haven't nearly completed it...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		Luke, you're not a researcher, 
		or a philosopher.  You're the 
		son of a Jedi.  Your brothers 
		accepted their destiny with joy 
		and pride.  Anyone would.  Why 
		can't you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I may be a good pilot, but I'm 
		not a warrior.  No matter how 
		hard I try.  It's just not in me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		I know, you'd rather carve a jud 
		stone, or work on your catalog of
		the ancients...I've trained seven 
		of your father's sons and it's 
		clear that you are not the most 
		gifted in the disciplines -- not 
		in power or speed, at any rate...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Deak was the best; but that didn't 
		seem to be good enough...</sp>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		But you have the way about you...
		and wisdom far beyond your years...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		You must learn to use such strength 
		and wits as you have.  Your father 
		has need of the Kiber Crystal. The 
		decision is yours.  I cannot bear 
		this burden for you, my duty is to 
		the twins.  But we must do something 
		soon.  The enemy is moving, and we 
		are no longer safe here.</sp>

<sd>Leia listens to the discussion with much interest.  She
		watches Luke with un-concealed admiration.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		Luke, if you do decide to go, re-
		member Ogana Major is far across 
		the galaxy.
		Without Deak to help you, the 
		way will be difficult, and 
		chances of your reaching your 
		father are slim.  Don't try it 
		if you think you are going to 
		fail.  The power of the Bogan 
		force has grown strong; but if 
		the Kiber Crystal were to fall 
		into the hands of the enemy, all 
		hope would be lost...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		Somehow, you will have to manage 
		to find transport in MOS EISLEY,
		and once you do, the way through 
		the Outland Systems will be dark 
		and dangerous.  The wild things 
		there are queer and savage, un-
		like anything you've experienced 
		here.</sp>

<sd>Leia is unable to control her concern.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Luke, you don't even know the "grip 
		of tython" or "the seven moves".
		You can't...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		Leia...</sp>

<sd>Leia settles down, but she is clearly worried.  There is a 
		long silence.  Owen sits back in his chair, and lights up 
		his pipe.  The twins can be heard playing with Artoo and 
		Threepio in the other room.  The silence becomes uncomfort-
		able.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I suppose I must go...</sp>

<sd>Tears begin to roll down Leia's cheeks, and she rushes from 
		the room.  Beru looks to Owen, who looks to Luke, who looks 
		embarrassed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		The prayers of all of us go 
		with you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		The Empire's vast size and power 
		is its greatest weakness.  I 
		think I can make it...But I would 
		rather help Deak trapped in the 
		heart of the Empire than face this 
		father I don't remember.</sp>

<sd>Owen gets up from the table and gently pats Luke on the
		shoulder.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="35"><setting>  EXT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GRAVE SITE - DUSK</setting>

<sd>Luke sits before a tall smooth stone planted on a burial
		mound.  He sits with his head bowed to his knees.  Finally 
		he stands up and speaks to the stone.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Well, Mom. I guess this is my last 
		visit...I'm going to finally get 
		to meet him...I fear many Jedi have 
		fallen since your death, for the 
		Bogan force is now heavy among us.
		Father asks for the Kiber Crystal 
		so there is little hope.  I'm sure 
		the boys will stay safe with Uncle 
		Owen...I sure miss you...</sp>

<sd>The twin suns of Utapau rest red on the horizon as Luke
		leaves the grave site and walks the short distance to the
		main house.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="36"><setting>  INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - MAIN LIVING AREA - DUSK</setting>

<sd>The main living area is a dim, cool room projecting a feel-
		ing of time-worn comfort and security. Owen lovingly moves 
		his arm around Beru as they stand before a large window 
		watching the giant twin suns of Utapau slowly disappear be-
		hind a distant dune range.</sd>

<sp>
	BERU
		Aren't they beautiful?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		"Always and never the same."</sp>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		Must we leave?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		I think with Luke going, we'll 
		be safe here for awhile.  We've 
		been the happiest here, haven't 
		we...</sp>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		Owen, he's not ready, is he?...
		Why don't you stop him?  What 
		was Deak thinking of to place 
		such an impossible task before 
		his brother...</sp>

<sd>The door opens and Luke enters, collapsing in a large, over-
		stuffed chair near a pot-belly thermal-heater which dominates 
		the room.  A warm friendly glow radiates from a tiny portal 
		in front of the heater.  Luke's gaze is fixed on the red em-
		bers, but his eyes are lit as if by a greater fire from 
		within.</sd>

<sd>Owen and Beru talk quietly in the background.  She rests her 
		head on his shoulder as the last rays of sunlight stream 
		across the floor of the room.  A playful Biggs and Windy 
		enter with Leia and stand in the doorway.  The twins are 
		dressed in their night clothes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		What's going on in here?</sp>

<sd>Luke returns from his world of dark thoughts and smiles at 
		them.  The twins rush up to Owen and Beru, give them a kiss, 
		then bounce over to Luke, and jump into his lap.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		Don't be too late now.</sp>

<sd>Owen and Beru take Leia into the other room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>WINDY</speaker>
		Why are you going away?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Because our father needs me, 
		as he will need you someday.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		I thought our father was killed?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		The time has come for me to 
		tell you of your heritage, as 
		Deak told it to me and as his 
		older brother Cliegg told it 
		to him.</sp>

<sd>The boys settle down and listen attentively.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>
		In another time, long before 
		the Empire, and before the 
		Republic had been formed, a 
		holy man called the Skywalker 
		became aware of a powerful 
		energy field which he believed 
		influenced the destiny of all 
		living creatures...</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		The "FORCE OF OTHERS"!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Yes, and after much study, he 
		was able to know the force, and 
		it communicated with him.  He 
		came to see things in a new way.
		His "aura" and powers grew very 
		strong.  The Skywalker brought a 
		new life to the people of his 
		system, and became one of the 
		founders of the Republic Galactica.</sp>

<sp><speaker>WINDY</speaker>
		The "FORCE OF OTHERS" talked to 
		him!?!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		In a manner different from the way 
		we talk.  As you know, the "FORCE 
		OF OTHERS" has two halves: Ashla, 
		the good, and Bogan, the paraforce 
		or evil part.  Fortunately, Skywalker 
		came to know the good half and was 
		able to resist the paraforce; but 
		he realized that if he taught others 
		the way of the Ashla, some, with 
		less strength, might come to know 
		Bogan, the dark side, and bring un-
		thinkable suffering to the Universe.
		For this reason, the Skywalker 
		entrusted the secret of THE 
		FORCE only to his twelve children, 
		and they in turn passed on the 
		knowledge only to their children, 
		who became known as the Jedi Bendu 
		of the Ashla: "the servants of 
		the force".  For thousands of 
		years, they brought peace and 
		justice to the galaxy.  At one 
		time there were several hundred 
		Jedi families, but now there are 
		only two or three.</sp>

<sp><speaker>WINDY</speaker>
		What happened to them?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		As the Republic spread throughout 
		the galaxy, encompassing over a 
		million worlds, the GREAT SENATE 
		grew to such overwhelming propor-
		tions that it no longer responded 
		to the needs of its citizens.
		After a series of assassinations 
		and elaborately rigged elections, 
		the Great Senate became secretly 
		controlled by the Power and Trans-
		port guilds.  When the Jedi dis-
		covered the conspiracy and attempted 
		to purge the Senate, they were de-
		nounced as traitors.  Several Jedi 
		allowed themselves to be tried and 
		executed, but most of them fled 
		into the Outland systems and tried 
		to tell people of the conspiracy.
		But the elders chose to remain behind, 
		and the Great Senate diverted them 
		by creating civil disorder.  The 
		Senate secretly instigated race wars, 
		and aided anti-government terrorists.
		They slowed down the system of jus-
		tice, which caused the crime rate 
		to rise to the point where a totally 
		controlled and oppressive police 
		state was welcomed by the systems.
		The Empire was born.  The systems 
		were exploited by a new economic 
		policy which raised the cost of 
		power and transport to unbelievable 
		heights.
		Many worlds were destroyed this 
		way.  Many people starved...</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		Why didn't the "FORCE OF OTHERS" 
		help the Jedi to put things right?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Because a terrible thing happened.
		During one of his lessons a young 
		PADAWAN-JEDI, a boy named Darklighter, 
		came to know the evil half of the 
		force, and fell victim to the spell 
		of the dreaded Bogan.  He ran away 
		from his instructor and taught the 
		evil ways of the Bogan Force to a 
		clan of Sith pirates, who then 
		spread untold misery throughout 
		the systems.  They became the per-
		sonal bodyguards of the Emperor.
		The Jedi were hunted down by these 
		deadly Sith knights.  With every 
		Jedi death, contact with the Ashla 
		grows weaker, and the force of the 
		Bogan grows more powerful.</sp>

<sp><speaker>WINDY</speaker>
		Where are the Jedi now?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		They're hidden; but many are still 
		fighting to free the systems from 
		the grip of the Empire.  Our father 
		is a Jedi.  He is called "The 
		Starkiller" and is said to be a 
		great and wise man, and tomorrow 
		I am on my way to join him and 
		learn the ways of the "FORCE OF 
		OTHERS".</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIGGS</speaker>
		Can we go, too?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Not yet, Biggs my boy.  There is 
		much you must learn from Uncle 
		Owen -- where it is safe.  And 
		when you are ready, I will come 
		back for you...I promise.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="37"><setting>  EXT. LARS HOMESTEAD - COURTYARD - DAWN</setting>

<sd>Early morning breaks across the quiet little courtyard as
		Owen and Luke lift supplies into the back of a low, bat-
		tered, two-man landspeeder.  Threepio lifts Artoo into a 
		tiny jump-seat, then climbs into the passenger compartment.  
		Beru, Leia, and the twins stand in the entryway, silently 
		watching. The storage hatch is slammed shut with a bang.
		Owen unfastens his gun-belt and hands it to Luke.  He slides 
		back a small latch on the belt buckle revealing a small 
		diamond-like crystal.  Luke carefully examines it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		The Kiber Crystal!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		The only one.  A Jedi can use 
		it to intensify the Ashla force 
		a hundred fold; but, remember it 
		can also be used to intensify the 
		power of the Bogan...It must not 
		fall into the hands of the Sith...
		They would do anything to have it.</sp>

<sd>Luke stands looking at the Crystal for a few moments, then 
		snaps the buckle closed and puts on the belt.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		The enemy is everywhere, so stay 
		alert.  If you keep due south, you 
		should make it in two days at the
		most.  I just hope you can sell this 
		bucket for enough to get you to the 
		Ogana System...</sp>

<sd>For a few awkward moments, Luke stands looking at everyone 
		not really wanting to say goodbye.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		It's a good day to travel. The 
		FORCE OF OTHERS is surely with 
		you.  We'll be moving on soon.
		I will send word once we're 
		settled...</sp>

<sd>Luke shakes his hand, and Owen gives him a big hug.  The young 
		adventurer then goes to his Aunt Beru and gives her a kiss 
		and a hug.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		The spaceport at Mos Eisley is 
		not a decent place.  Be careful 
		there.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'll watch out, Aunt Beru.
		Don't worry.</sp>

<sd>He lovingly roughs up the twins, and starts to give Leia a 
		kiss, but thinks better of it and gives her a short polite 
		hug before retreating to the speeder.  Leia is greatly dis-
		appointed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
		Wish your father well.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BERU</speaker>
		May the FORCE OF OTHERS be 
		with you.</sp>

<sd>Luke pops open the door of the speeder; but before he can
		get in, Leia runs up and gives him a big kiss.  Luke is sur-
		prised and embarrassed.  Beru and Owen smile, as Leia rushes 
		back into the house.  Luke settles into the speeder and it 
		starts with a crack and loud whine.  Everyone waves as the 
		speeder roars out of the courtyard, and into the desolate 
		Utapau wilderness.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="38"><setting>  EXT. LANDSPEEDER - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>The sleek landspeeder glides effortlessly through the
		treacherous rock canyons and out onto the awesome dune sea.  
		The vibrations of the speeder causes Artoo's outer shell to 
		rattle a rhythmic little tune.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		How long were you with my 
		brother?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I had the pleasure of serving 
		Master Deak for over three years
		...my counterpart was with him
		a bit longer.</sp>

<sd>Artoo chatters to his bronze interpreter.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		...Three years eight months.
		Master Deak is a man above men.
		You should be proud of him,
		indeed you should, sir.  I'm 
		only a "droid", and not much 
		more than an interpreter, and 
		not very good at poetry, if you 
		take my meaning -- not at making 
		it up anyway.
		So I can't tell you what he's 
		really like.  But a great man 
		he is!  Strong...with great 
		skill...I hope he's not in 
		peril...what a dilemma! Some-
		times the logic of human rela-
		tions escapes me...</sp>

<sd>Luke thinks about this for a few moments; then rather reluc-
		tantly, almost afraid, he asks a second question.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Have you ever met my father?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		No, I'm afraid not, sir.  I 
		couldn't even tell you what he 
		looks like.  He's an elusive one.
		More of a myth than a man, if I 
		may say so, sir...But Master Deak 
		always spoke of him with great 
		respect...</sp>

<sd>Luke seems a little disappointed with Threepio's answer.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="39"><setting>  EXT. DUNE SEA</setting>

<sd>The small speeder sits at the bottom of a huge sand dune.  
		Luke, with his extremely long-barreled laser rifle slung 
		over his shoulder, makes his way to the top of the ridge.
		He studies the landscape with his electro-binoculars, until
		he spots a small dust twister speeding toward them.  He 
		quickly slides back down the dune to where Threepio is lift-
		ing Artoo out of the speeder.  The stubby little robot 
		struts around stretching his joints between irritated whis-
		tles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		You were right, there is some-
		thing following us.  We'd better 
		move on.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Who do you suppose it is?  Do you 
		think they're looking for us?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		It's probably nothing.  A "jom-

		a strange feeling about it.</sp>

<sd>DISSOLVE TO:</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="40"><setting>  EXT. PLANET UTAPAU - MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT</setting>

<sd>The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at
		MOS EISLEY.  It is a haphazard array of low gray concrete
		structures and semi-domes.  A harsh gale blows across the
		bleak canyon floor and batters Luke as he lowers his sand
		goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff.  A
		leaden sky presses down on the large settlement, which seems 
		to be losing a never-ending battle against the shifting 
		sands.  Something in the distance catches his eye, and he 
		instinctively grabs his electrobinoculars.  He follows a 
		sinister-black "tusken" landspeeder as it enters the space-
		port.  Luke returns to his speeder, and his two mechanical 
		companions.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Well, whoever was following us 
		has gone into Mos Eisley...they 
		weren't "jom traders", that's 
		for sure...It was a speeder of

</scene>
<scene n="41"><setting>  EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - SLUM DWELLINGS</setting>

<sd>Luke stops the speeder before the remains of a burnt-out
		spaceship the size of a large jet fighter.  Two scruffy
		figures huddle around a small thermal-heater, attempting
		to use the spacecraft as shelter against the howling winds.  
		One of the rag-tag figures gets up and ventures over to 
		Luke in the speeder.  When the shabby beggar stands up, it 
		is obvious from his pint size that he is a Jawa.  Artoo 
		lets out a string of electronic beeps and whistles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I begging your pardon, sir, but 
		watch out for this guy.</sp>

<sd>The wretched little creature moves close to the speeder and 
		begins to run his gnarled little hand across it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Where might I find passage on a 
		starship?</sp>

<sp><speaker>JAWA</speaker>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<sd>Saliva dribbles from the dark hole where the Jawa's face
		should be and drops, splat, on the hood of the speeder.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JAWA</speaker>
		Drink place.  Drink place down 
		the street.  Nice zoom zoom.</sp>

<sd>The Jawa continues to fondle the speeder as Luke starts the 
		magno-system.  The filthy little creature reluctantly jumps 
		away as the speeder takes off and glides down the dismal 
		spaceport street.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="42"><setting>  EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - CANTINA</setting>

<sd>The speeder pulls up in front of a run-down, blockhouse can-

		forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of bur-
		den, are parked outside the bar.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I can't abide those Jawas. Dis-
		gusting creatures.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Take care in here.  I don't like 
		the looks of this place.</sp>

<sd>As the trio exit the speeder, an ancient human shrouded in 
		gray robes, sitting near the entrance to the cantina calls 
		out to them.  The man appears to be a blind beggar.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SEER</speaker>

		be known.</sp>

<sd>Luke reluctantly approaches the old man.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SEER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I've seen what is to be.  I can 
		tell you what you need to know...</sp>

<sd>Luke drops several coins in the man's open palm.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Can you tell me where I might find
		transport to Ogana Major?</sp>

<sp><speaker>SEER</speaker>
		Your fate is clouded...but the will 
		of the force has set your path. The 
		man you seek you'll find inside; 
		the one who needs you, you'll find 
		in time.
		Fear not, for the "son of the 
		suns" will free us all.  Take 
		care for the Bogan is heavy 
		upon this system.  May the 
		FORCE OF OTHERS be with you.</sp>

<sd>Luke is somewhat puzzled by the old man's dialogue.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		A profoundly illogical answer.
		He's not completely with us, if 
		you take my meaning.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="43"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT CANTINA</setting>

<sd>The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants enter 
		the smoke-filled cantina.  The murky, moldy den is filled 
		with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures 
		and monsters, laughing at the long metallic bar.  At first, 
		the sight is horrifying.  One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
		furry, scaly tentacles and claws huddle over drinks.  Luke 
		moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive 
		but human Corellian pirates.  A huge, rough-looking BAR-
		TENDER comes over to Luke and the robots.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker>
		We don't serve "their kind" in 
		here.</sp>

<sd>Luke, still recovering from the shock of seeing so many out-
		landish creatures in one room, doesn't quite catch the bar-
		tender's drift.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		What?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker>
		Your "Droids" will have to wait 
		outside.  We don't serve 'em 
		here.</sp>

<sd>Luke notices that several of the creatures along the bar are 
		giving them a very unfriendly glare.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Yes, of course, I'm so sorry.
(he turns to
Threepio)
		You'd better stay with the
		speeder.
		We don't want any trouble...
		I'll bring you something...</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I must say, I agree, sir.</sp>

<sd>Threepio and his stubby partner go outside, and most of the 
		creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.  Luke is stand-
		ing next to HAN SOLO, a young Corellian pirate only a few 
		years older than himself.  He is a burly-bearded but ruggedly 
		handsome boy dressed in a gaudy array of flamboyant apparel.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Do you know of any ship heading 
		toward the
		Ogana Systems?</sp>

<sd>Han Solo eyes him suspiciously.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		What's your business, little one?</sp>

<sd>Han turns to his companion, CHEWBACCA, an eight foot tall, 
		savage-looking creature resembling a huge gray bush-baby 
		monkey with fierce "baboon"-like fangs.  His large yellow 
		eyes dominate a fur-covered face and soften his otherwise 
		awesome appearance.  Over his matted, furry body, he wears 
		two chrome bandoliers, a flak jacket painted in a bizarre 
		camouflage pattern, brown cloth shorts, and little else.
		He is a two-hundred-year-old "WOOKIEE", and a sight to be-
		hold.  Han speaks to the Wookiee in his own language, which 
		is little more than a series of grunts.  The young pirate 
		points to Luke several times during his conversation and 
		the creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh.  Han 
		chuckles to himself and turns back to Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		What would you be doing going 
		on such a trip?  Ogana Major 
		is part of the Alliance...You 
		wouldn't be one of those rebels, 
		would yuh, little one?</sp>

<sd>He can't control his laughter, and Chewbacca starts in again, 
		also.  Luke is getting a little worried.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I just want passage.</sp>

<sd>Han puts his arm around Luke's shoulder and draws him near.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Listen, little one, why don't 
		you go on back to the farm or 
		wherever you come from.  Then 
		maybe in a few years you'll 
		grow up to become an important 
		starpilot, like me.</sp>

<sd>He lets out a hearty laugh and turns back to the giant Wookiee.  
		Luke is afraid, but tries not to show it.  He quietly sips 
		his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear, 
		or whatever.  A large multiple-eyed creature on the other side 
		of Luke gives him a rather rough shove.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CREATURE</speaker>
		Negola dughi wooldugger?!?</sp>

<sd>The hideous freak is obviously drunk.  Luke tries to ignore 
		the creatures and turns back to his drink.  A short grubby 
		HUMAN and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belli-
		gerent monstrosity.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker>
		He doesn't like you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'm sorry.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker>
		I don't like you either.</sp>

<sd>The big creature is getting agitated, and yells some unin-
		telligible gibberish at the now rather nervous young Jedi.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Don't insult us.  You just watch 
		yourself.  We're wanted men. I 
		have the death sentence on twelve 
		systems.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'11 be careful then.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HUMAN</speaker>
		You'll be dead.</sp>

<sd>The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
		moves away.  Luke tries to remain cool, but it isn't easy.</sd>

<sd>His three adversaries ready their weapons.  Han Solo, who
		has been watching the chain of events, begins to feel sorry 
		for the young tenderfoot and intervenes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		This little one isn't worth 
		the effort.  Besides, he's 
		leaving.  Come, let me buy 
		you something.</sp>

<sd>A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
		Corellian pirate sailing across the room, crashing through 
		tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking 
		liquid.  With a blood-curdling shriek, the monster draws a 
		wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt.  The bartender 
		panics!</sd>

<sp><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker>
		No blasters!!  No blaster!
		Please!</sp>

<sd>Little Luke's laser sword sparks to life, and in a flash,
		an arm lies on the floor.  The rodent is cut in two, and the 
		giant, multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin 
		to groin.  Luke shaking, and somewhat amazed at his reflex 
		powers, replaces his sword in its sheath.  The entire fight 
		has lasted only a matter of seconds.  The cantina goes back 
		to normal, although Luke is now given a respectable amount 
		of room at the bar.  Han, rubbing his bruised head, approaches 
		the "little one" with new awe.  The bartender drags the 
		bodies out.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I could have saved myself a good 
		bump if I had known your skill...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I thank you for trying to help.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		They're lucky they caught me off 
		guard.  I would have taken more 
		time with them.  It's the Bogan 
		force.  We've been feeling it for 
		several days.  It drives those 
		MONDUTHS wild...I'm Han Solo.
		This is my first-mate Chewbacca.</sp>

<sd>Luke is still giddy, and downs a fresh drink.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		So you're looking for transport 
		to Ogana...I might be able to 
		help, but it's very far -- the 
		cost would be great.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I can pay.  You know of a ship 
		going in that direction?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		In these times, one cannot be 
		too careful, you understand --
		going into a rebel zone and all
		-- but come to my place.  We'll 
		have some food and talk this over.</sp>

<sd>Luke is filled with grateful enthusiasm at his new-found
		"friends" and ignores their sinister grins.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="44"><setting>  EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - ALLEYWAY</setting>

<sd>Han, Chewbacca, Luke and the robots walk along a narrow slum 
		alleyway crowded with darkly-clad creatures hawking exotic 
		goods in dingy little stalls.  Men and monsters crouch in 
		waste-filled doorways whispering and hiding from the chill-
		ing winds.  They enter a small doorway in a decaying stone 
		building at the far end of the alley.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="45"><setting>  INT. SLUM DWELLING - LIVING AREA</setting>

<sd>The seedy slum dwelling is dark and dingy.  Han is greeted 
		by a female "Boma" named OEETA.  The Boma is a fur-covered 
		creature about five feet high and looks like a cross between 
		a brown bear and a guinea pig.  It is obvious from her figure 
		that she is a female.  Han embraces Oeeta and gives her a 
		big kiss, then checks out the stew-like mess boiling away 
		on a dilapidated fusion-burner in the kitchen area.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Good, good...We're hungry.
		Bring my friends some of this.</sp>

<sd>She answers in a strange baboon-like call and starts dish-
		ing up the slop.  Threepio and Artoo cautiously dust off a 
		bench in the kitchen and sit down.  Luke and Chewbacca join 
		Han at a large table in the center of the main room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Now tell me of your adventures.
		What is on Ogana Major that draws 
		you there?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I am looking to join my father.  
		I have been living with my uncle, 
		beyond the Great Dune sea.  He 
		has a small moisture ranch -- 
		not much of an adventure, I'm 
		afraid.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Ahh, no farmer could cut down 
		three brigands as you did.  But, 
		as you wish.  In time you will 
		grow to trust me...</sp>

<sd>Oeeta brings them each a steaming bowl of "Boma-mush", and 
		a large mug of some heavy brew.  Chewbacca and Han dig in 
		with great vigor, but Luke is a little hesitant.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Eat up, don't let its smell 
		bother you...Now, for the right 
		sum, I could take you to Ogana 
		Major myself.  But it would be a 
		special charter.  I have no other 
		business in that area, and the way 
		is a little dangerous.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		How much?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		An even million, I think.  We will 
		have to somehow sneak past the 
		Imperial blockade.  It won't be 
		easy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		A million!  I haven't that much.
		I hope to get one fifty for my 
		speeder...but that's all I have.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Well, I doubt you'll find another 
		ship to take you.  Most captains 
		rarely venture there.  The civil 
		war makes it far too dangerous...
		I was sure a man of your 
		abilities would be worth more.
		What of your two "droids" --
		you could get at least four or 
		five for them...even if you sold 
		them as scrap.</sp>

<sd>Artoo and Threepio become suddenly attentive and listen
		closely to the conversation in the next room.  Artoo begins 
		to beep, but Threepio puts his bronze hand over his little 
		companion's mouth.  Luke thinks about this for a moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		No...I need them.  What if I 
		were to pay you one fifty now, 
		and my father gave you the rest 
		on our arrival?  He is an honor-
		able man of great influence.  I'm 
		sure he would make it worth your 
		while.</sp>

<sd>The two robots breathe a sigh of relief.  Han's waning in-
		terest is renewed by the mention of "great influence".</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		You mean a bonus maybe.  Your 
		father must be a man of great 
		wealth?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'm sure he would reward you.</sp>

<sd>Han thinks about this for a few moments, then turns to
		Chewbacca and seemingly explains the situation to him.  The 
		Wookiee shrugs his shoulders as if to say "Why not?"</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		We've got a deal then.  Sell your 
		speeder and I'll meet you at dock-
		ing port twenty-three.  My ship 
		will be ready and waiting for you.
		We should go right away, I think.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="46"><setting>  EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING PORT 23</setting>

<sd>Han and his lumbering first-mate Chewbacca hurry along be-
		hind MONTROSS HOLDAACK, a large, portly man who walks with 
		a stiff, awkward gait.  They move along a tall gantry over-
		looking a long, complex spacecraft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		But you're my friend, my best and 
		closest partner.  Oxus will still 
		listen to you!  He will, I tell 
		you, I know he will.  I really have
		a live one this time.  I asked for 
		a million, and he didn't even flinch, 
		and the way he fights -- he must 
		belong to one of the royal families, 
		I'm just sure of it.  This may be 
		worth two million, maybe three.
		You've got to talk to Oxus...You've 
		just got to...</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Like your information on the AKURIAN 
		spice shipment...After that botch, 
		if I WERE crazy enough to suggest 
		another one of your plots to him, 
		he'd have us both diced...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		But this is different.  This is 
		our chance.  Are we partners or 
		not?  Are you going to dream away 
		the rest or your life, or are we 
		going to try for the big one?</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		The only way Oxus would go along is 
		if you killed him...I'm too old, 
		Han.  I can't do it, you'll have to 
		find someone else.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		There's no time.  What kind of talk 
		is this?  Where's the old Montross 
		that single-handedly destroyed a 
		colony of Banthas and rescued me 
		from the very jaws of death??
		Montross, the greatest science 
		officer in the galaxy, too old?!</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		You young fool!</sp>

<sd>Montross suddenly ignites in a rage and swings his left
		forearm down with a mighty blow across the metal rail of
		the gantry. The old science officer's forearm cracks in
		two, spewing forth wires, and many fine multi-colored elec-
		tronic components.</sd>

<sd>The artificial limb flops lifelessly to Montross Holdaack's 
		side.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS (CONT'D)</speaker>
		You know, there is nothing left 
		but my head and right arm...
		I've lost too much, Han...I'm 
		dying...I'm dying this time...
		I'm losing control.</sp>

<sd>Han bows his head in sorrow and embarrassment for one of the 
		greatest warriors in the galaxy and a dear friend.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Take it easy...I'm sorry.  Don't 
		be upset.  What am I going to do?
		He's going to be here shortly 
		wanting to go to Ogana!  I'll 
		just have to talk to Oxus myself.
		I'll take care of everything.
		We'll get you fixed up, once and 
		for all.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="47"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - ENTRY BAY</setting>

<sd>The entry bay of the large starship is also the main lounge 
		area of the ship.  Two gruff and grisly pirates are playing 
		a kind of dice game with thin little sticks.  The larger 
		and mangiest of the two slavering hulks, JABBA THE HUTT 
		by name, throws his dice at Chewbacca.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
		I told you not to bring that 
		thing on board again...Where 
		have you been anyway...Captain 
		wants the conveyor system ex-
		tended...and I notice you haven't 
		turned around those punch chips 
		yet.  What are we keeping you 
		on board for anyway?</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca slinks back outside the starship as Han helps the 
		still slightly crazed Montross aboard the craft.  Han gen-
		erally ignores Jabba's tirade.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Where is everybody, anyway?</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
		They took the shipment of "Covina" 
		to Gordon.
		But the captain is still here, 
		so get to work or I'll snap you 
		myself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Where is he?</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
		On the bridge, I think.  I 
		wouldn't go looking for trouble, 
		though...He'll sting you good 
		if you bother him.</sp>

<sd>The second pirate notices Montross's arm, as Han sets him
		on a bench near the door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PIRATE</speaker>
		Montross fall apart again?</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
		What's this ship coming to?
		We've got a good-for-nothing 
		"cabin boy" and a disintegrating 
		science officer.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="48"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>The cockpit of the starship is crowded with a haphazard ar-
		ray of computer switches and monitors.  Dozing in one of 
		the two pilot chairs is CAPTAIN OXUS, a man of the grossest 
		dimensions.  His scarred face is a grim testimonial to his 
		prowess as a pirate and a killer.  The young Han Solo en-
		ters the cabin and stands staring at the evil galactic 
		buccaneer -- the terror of the Outland territories -- so 
		peaceful, such an easy prey.  Han doesn't know quite what 
		to do, so he starts to leave. Oxus opens one eye.  He is 
		in a drunken stupor.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OXUS</speaker>
		What have you been up to, boy??
		You finished with the conveyor 
		system?  Bring me some more 
		"Auraspice"!</sp>

<sd>Han bows low before his master, then moves down the narrow 
		passageway to a small closet, where he takes out a cup of 
		silver powder and returns to Oxus.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Your spice; sir...Ah, sir, may I...</sp>

<sp><speaker>OXUS</speaker>
		You blasted, good-for-nothing.
		Go fetch my tallock!  And be 
		quick.  Now get out of here!</sp>

<sd>He takes a mighty swing at the boy, but his inebriated con-
		dition causes the blow to ricochet off, and slam against a 
		locker panel.  Han rushes out of the room.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="49"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>Han is angry with himself for not being able to tell the
		captain about Luke.  He kicks the door to a locker in dis-
		gust.  Suddenly an idea comes to him and he rushes back 
		down the hallway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="50"><setting>  EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING PORT 23</setting>

<sd>Luke and the two robots approach the entry bay of the giant 
		starship, and are intercepted by the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Greetings!  For such a young 
		captain, your master has a 
		mighty ship.  Will you store 
		our bags?</sp>

<sd>Luke hands the huge funny creature his back-pack, but the
		Wookiee doesn't take it. Instead, Chewbacca refuses to let 
		them pass and carries on about something in his harsh na-
		tive tongue.  Luke doesn't understand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I don't get it??  Are we to wait 
		here, or what?  Threepio, what's 
		he talking about?</sp>

<sd>The gleaming bronze robot jabbers away in strange animal
		sounds to the towering monster.  They carry on an animated 
		argument, until it appears Threepio gets in the last word.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Well, master Luke, sir.  It ap-
		pears we must wait out here for 
		the captain to ready the ship.
		I told him we weren't accustomed 
		to waiting around on gantries; 
		and if you beg my pardon, sir, 
		for the price of this trip they 
		should have picked you up in an 
		environment capsule, complete 
		with dancing "Yonnas".</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="51"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>Han and Montross are busy prying loose a control panel in
		a forward corridor of the ship.  The cover falls to the
		floor with a loud clang, and the young cabin boy looks
		around to see if anyone heard.  Montross takes a small metal 
		bar and jams it between two circuits.  Sparks, fly and a 
		small puff of smoke issues from the panel.  He quickly re-
		places the cover and Han heads back toward the captain's 
		bridge.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="52"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>The cockpit area of the starship is a cacophony of warning 
		alarms and flashing lights.  The captain clumsily works at 
		the control console in a vain attempt to figure out what 
		is going on.  Han enters carrying a long gray cloak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Your tallock, sir.  What's wrong??</sp>

<sd>Oxus stumbles around in a drunken stupor.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OXUS</speaker>
		Something's fouled up on this 
		blasted board...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		The reactor's wild!  It's way over 
		a thousand.  We'd better get out.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OXUS</speaker>
		That's impossible!  I may be under 
		the influence, but the reactor 
		couldn't have gotten loose...Wait 
		a minute.</sp>

<sd>A new shrill alarm begins to sound, as Han grabs the groggy 
		old pirate and drags him out of the cabin.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="53"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - ENTRY BAY</setting>

<sd>Han and the lumbering pirate captain charge into the entry 
		bay, almost knocking down Jabba the Hutt.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
		What's going on?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Sabotage!  The reactor's have gone 
		wild.  Get out.  Get out...Wait, I 
		forgot about Montross...</sp>

<sd>Jabba the Hutt and the other pirate stumble over each other, 
		racing for the exit.  Little Artoo scoots out of the way 
		just as the two pirates rush past the group and into the 
		spacestation main building.  They are quickly followed by 
		the wobbly captain.  Luke watches the trio with puzzled 
		amazement as the blast door slides closed behind them.  
		Chewbacca gets a message on his belt com-link, and gestures 
		to Luke that they should enter the deserted starship.  Luke 
		and the two robots reluctantly follow the giant Wookiee 
		into the entry bay.  Chewbacca pushes a button, and the main 
		hatch slams shut. The alarms continue to ring.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Where's the captain?</sp>

<sd>Threepio repeats the question in Wookieese and gets a short, 
		rather menacing answer from the creature, who points to the 
		high-backed seat of the lounge area.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		He wants us to sit down, sir...
		If we don't mind.  The captain 
		will be with us shortly.</sp>

<sd>The alarm signal is suddenly cut short.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="54"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>The one armed Montross sits in the pilot seat pushing but-

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Alarms secure...ready for take-
		off...let's get out of here be-
		fore they figure out what happened.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Yes sir, captain.</sp>

<sd>Montross laughs heartily as he pulls back on the throttle.
		The ship shudders as it lifts off.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="55"><setting>  INT. DOCKING PORT 23 - MAIN BUILDING</setting>

<sd>Captain Oxus and Jabba the Hutt stand before a large window

</scene>
<scene n="56"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>Han sits back in the huge co-pilot's chair and puts his

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Sometimes I amaze myself...</sp>

<sd>He chuckles.  The surface of Utapau slowly drifts out of
		view of the cockpit windows and is replaced by a sparkling 
		carpet of stars.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Are you even a little worried 
		he might hunt you down?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Well, Montross my friend, it's a 
		big universe.  And after we cash 
		in on this young noble, we'll 
		head for Ophichi or one of the 
		other southern systems.  He'll 
		be a long time coming there!</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Sometimes you amaze me, also.</sp>

<sd>They both laugh.  Little Artoo appears momentarily in the
		doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.
		In a few moments, Luke appears at the doorway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		This is a terrific ship!  How did 
		you ever come by it?</sp>

<sd>Montross gives Han a sly smile, as Artoo appears timidly
		behind his master.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		It's a long story...I suggest you 
		relax.  We'll be going into a

<sd>Han stands nervously waiting for Chewbacca, who is looking 
		through Luke's things as the young adventurer sleeps.  The 
		huge furry creature is very quiet as he moves about the 
		cabin.  He picks up Luke's gun belt containing the hidden 
		Kiber Crystal.  He takes the belt and a pouch to his wait-
		ing master, and quietly whispers to him.  Han begins to 
		search the belt.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		He must have SOMETHING of value.
		Are you sure you looked through 
		everything?  His father had bet-
		ter be loaded.</sp>

<sd>He drops the belt and pouch in disgust.</sd>

<scene n="58"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING IN SPACE</setting>

<sd>Han enters and flops down in the co-pilot's seat.  Montross 
		is busy studying the solar system with the ship's scanner.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		We've been through everything 
		twice.  He has nothing with him.
		I guess we'll just have to wait 
		until we get to his father.</sp>

<sd>Montross looks up from the scanner with a worried look.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		I've scanned almost all the way 
		to Ogana Major, and there is no 
		blockade!  I don't get it.  Do 
		you think we should continue?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Sure, why not?...but carefully.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="59"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - LOUNGE AREA</setting>

<sd>Luke, Chewbacca and the two robots sit around a lighted
		table covered with many small metal figures. Each side of
		the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it.
		Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his
		lanky fur-covered arms over his head.  Luke rests his chin 
		in his hands as he ponders a weighty problem on the board.  
		Finally the stubby Artoo reaches up and moves one of the 
		figures on the board.  A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
		face and he begins yelling some gibberish at Artoo.  Threepio 
		intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to 
		argue with the huge Wookiee.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Let him have it...You're winning 
		anyway...It doesn't make any dif-
		ference.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Yes sir, but it's the principle of 
		the thing.</sp>

<sd>A small tone sounds and the com-link crackles to life.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN'S VOICE</speaker>
		Luke, could you come up here!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'm on my way.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="60"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING IN SPACE</setting>

<sd>The cockpit is alive with humming meters and softly buzz-
		ing read-outs.  Montross and Han are busy at the controls.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		It checks out again.  There is 
		no mistake about it.</sp>

<sd>Luke enters; his boyish enthusiasm is working overtime.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		We must be just about there!</sp>

<sd>Both Han and Montross are rather grim-faced.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		We ARE there...Ogana Major has 
		been destroyed...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		What!  What are you saying?</sp>

<sd>Luke moves close and begins to search the viewing monitors.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		What's left of it is contaminated.
		That's it there...look at those 
		radiation read-outs!...and the 
		blockade is gone.  Now what's going 
		on?</sp>

<sd>Luke sits down in a state of shock.  He stares blankly at
		the monitor read-outs.  Han is very angry at this turn of
		events.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		I don't care how large the Imperial 
		fleet has become, it couldn't have 
		done this.  Half the planet is torn 
		away.  It would have taken a thousand 
		ships with a lot more fire power than 
		I've ever seen...very fascinating.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Well, I don't like it.  Where is 
		your father?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		He must be dead...All this way and 
		he's probably dead...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Who's going to pay us??</sp>

<sd>The young pirate captain grabs Luke and holds him high
		against the cockpit wall.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I'm beginning not to like you!</sp>

<sd>Luke clears his throat and snaps out of his depression.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Deak!  Deak would know...my brother.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		What?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		My brother could help us.  He would 
		know what to do.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Could he pay us?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		He might know what happened. He's
		...ah...in a bit of a fix.  I'm
		sure he would be most grateful if 
		we helped him.</sp>

<sd>Han puts the boy down and a scheme formulates in Luke's mind.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>
		If my father is dead, then every-
		thing is his...but it's no use. We 
		could never get to him...it's im-
		possible.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Nothing's impossible.  Not for 
		me anyway.  Tell me where he is 
		and we'll go there.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		He's being held prisoner...You 
		couldn't help him...No one could, 
		not even a Jedi Bendu knight 
		could...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I could.  Where is he?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Alderaan.</sp>

<sd>The word hits Han and Montross like a mad bantha; but Han
		recovers nicely, and thinks about it for a moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Well, he's right, you can't go 
		there.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Why not?  The fact that no one 
		in their right mind would ever 
		try might make it easy...You're 
		sure your brother would make it 
		worth our while?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Beyond your wildest dreams...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		You have no fear of Alderaan?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		As you said, the fact that no one 
		would venture there voluntarily 
		makes it easy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		You boys have the space giddies...
		but calculating the probabilities, 
		you may have something...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Chart a new course...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Boy, will Deak be surprised to see 
		us.</sp>

<sd>Montross gives the two boys a doubtful glance.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="61"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - LOUNGE AREA</setting>

<sd>Han, Chewbacca, Luke, and the robots sit around a large table 
		in the lounge area of the starship.  Han and Luke are deep 
		in thought.  Luke sits up.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I thought starcaptains were 
		supposed to be clever.  I 
		thought you did this kind of 
		thing all the time...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Well, I do, of course.  But 
		Alderaan...even I've never 
		been there.  When I said I'd 
		take you...I thought you al-
		ready had a plan...</sp>

<sd>Montross enters the lounge area and sits down.  He flexes
		his new left arm which was just replaced.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		This new arm is a lot stiffer 
		than the last one.  They just 
		don't make these things the way 
		they used to...We've reached 
		the first perimeter of Alderaan.
		What's the next move?</sp>

<sd>Everyone is lost in deep and perplexing thoughts.  He is
		slightly amused at the young adventurer's dilemma.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I guess there is only one thing 
		to do, and that is to fly right 
		in there and take over...we can 
		do it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Whoa there...May I make a sugges-
		tion to the captain?  There is only 
		one way into Alderaan, and N0 way 
		out.  It's an island city suspended 
		in a sea of cirrus methane.  The 
		dungeons have triple guards, scramble
		scanners, gas locks, and every sec-
		tor is isolated...and most important,
		it's the dwelling place of the Bogan 
		Master: Prince Valorum.  This ven-
		ture of yours is sheer madness; but 
		I have calculated the probabilities, 
		and there might be a way.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		How??</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		It is a rather complex plan; but 
		it has the greatest probability 
		of working...Go to the library, 
		get all the tapes on Imperial 
		procedure...You will have to learn 
		the...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		We're going to get in by studying
		procedures??  I don't like it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		All right then, we'll use your 
		plan.</sp>

<sd>Han slumps in his seat with a dejected look.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		All right, get the tapes.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		...and we're going to need the
		space on all of our scan-shielded
		compartments and lockers.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		What do you want with our scan-
		proof lockers?</sp>

<scene n="62"><setting> EXT. SPACE AROUND PLANET ALDERAAN</setting>

<sd>The long ornate pirate starship approaches the gray gaseous 
		planet of Alderaan.  The ship is not propelled, but simply 
		drifts crab-like toward the planet.  As it approaches the 
		surface, huge billowing clouds extend out like menacing 
		tentacles.  The peacefulness of this nebulous idyll is 
		broken by the increasing wail of ion engines.  Suddenly, 
		four sleek space fighters from the Imperial third fleet 
		burst from the huge cumulus range.  The craft are small 
		cylindrical power shells dominated by two huge solar fins.  
		They are flying in a tight formation; then two bank steeply 
		and head toward the drifting starship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="63"><setting>  INT. IMPERIAL FIGHTER - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>The Imperial fighters are four-man craft crammed with sophis-
		ticated electronic weaponry.</sd>

<sd>The PILOT and GUNNERY OFFICER sit side by side, surrounded 
		by lighted read-outs.  They wear the gleaming black uni-
		forms of the dungeon guards.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT</speaker>
		No reply on any circuits...She 
		appears to be drifting; but 
		you'd better give her a blast 
		anyway.</sp>

<sd>Two laser bolts scream past the cockpit and explode in front 
		of the drifting pirate ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Kuro one to AD four.  We have 
		what appears to be a drifting 
		TDFI04 which does not respond 
		to warnings.  No life forms 
		appear on the scanner...Escape 
		pods four, seven, and Oh three 
		have been jettisoned...Should 
		we destroy her or attempt sal-
		vage?  She looks in good shape. 
		...Right...Will do.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="64"><setting>  EXT. SPACE AROUND PLANET ALDERAAN</setting>

<sd>The two tiny fighter craft orbit in front of the pirate star-
		ship as small plates shoot from their fins and attach them-
		selves to the larger craft.  Lines pull taut and the pirate 
		starship is towed among the towering gray clouds by the two 
		little Imperial space fighters.  The second two space fighters 
		take up position behind the starship and follow it in.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="65"><setting>  INT. IMPERIAL FIGHTER - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>The pilot is cold and professional as his craft closes in
		on the starship.  The positions of the ships are displayed 
		on a read-out.  The pilot gives the gunner a quick look be-
		fore he flips his sun shield over his eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT</speaker>
		It appears to be a Corellian 
		Gypsy vessel, as close as I 
		can make out...Still no life 
		forms, no contamination.  Life 
		systems still functioning...

		some reason.  We'll bring her

<sp><speaker>COM-LINK</speaker>

</scene>
<scene n="66"><setting>  EXT. PLANET ALDERAAN - CLOUD SEA</setting>

<sd>The towering white oxide clouds pass, revealing the Imperial 
		city of Alderaan.  The magnificent domed and gleaming city 
		is perched, mushroom-like, on a tall spire which disappears 
		deep into the misty surface of the planet.  The little pro-
		cession of spaceships speeds toward the city.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="67"><setting>  INT. MAIN FORWARD BAY - SPACEPORT - IMPERIAL CITY OF ALDERAAN</setting>

<sd>The pirate starship rests in a huge hangar bay which dwarfs 
		the Corellian craft!  Hundreds of troops work their way 
		toward the craft under the cover of reflective shields.  A 
		battalion commander and two guards edge their way toward 
		the main hatch.  One of the guards aims a long laser rifle 
		at the hatch.  A commotion erupts behind the troops, and 
		they turn to see two SITH KNIGHTS striding into the huge 
		spaceport hangar.  The two Sith knights appear slightly 
		amused at the cautious stormtroopers.  The battalion com-
		mander bows before the dark and fearsome Sith knights.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIRST KNIGHT</speaker>
		Chief, get your men back.  Let us 
		check this out.
(to the other Sith)
		These MANTHAS troops are getting 
		far too timid.</sp>

<sd>The Sith knights boldly approach the ship and swing open
		the hatch.  They start to enter the ship when a loud clank-
		ing sound, somewhat like a wrench being dropped down an air 
		shaft, startles them and they jump back.  The Sith warriors 
		ignite their laser swords simultaneously, and take a defen-
		sive stance.  The hundred or so troopers duck behind their 
		chrome shields and direct their laser weapons at the open 
		hatch.  A few more sounds are heard from within the giant 
		starship.  The tension becomes almost palpable.  The gang-
		ling, bronze Threepio pops his "Art Deco" head out of the 
		hatchway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Hello!</sp>

<sd>The two Sith knights give each other rather puzzled looks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg 
		relations.
		It appears my masters have de-
		parted, leaving me with their 
		abandoned starship.  My only 
		problem is that the operation 
		of Astro-vehicles is not within 
		my capacity...</sp>

<sd>The first Sith knight turns back to the battalion commander.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FIRST KNIGHT</speaker>
		Chief, hold this thing for in-
		spection, and check out the 
		rest of the ship.  I think you 
		have picked up a piece of drift 
		junk.  Salvage what you can, 
		and atomize the rest.  Next time 
		a little more bravery, commander.
		WAIT before you call us.</sp>

<sd>The Sith knights leave the hangar as the troops shuffle on 
		board the deserted vessel.  Threepio seems confused as 
		troops rush around, completely ignoring him.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="68"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - LOUNGE AREA</setting>

<sd>The troops search the ship with small hand scanners.  The
		commander and his aid enter the lounge.  They are approached 
		by a slender, weasel-like OFFICER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		There are no other "droids", sir.
		The ship isn't much -- a rag-tag, 
		custom-built job...Might be worth 
		some study...</sp>

<sd>A TROOPER approaches the group.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TROOPER</speaker>
		All clear, sir.  There is a row 
		of supply lockers we couldn't 
		get into.</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
		Let the scavenger crews take care 
		of that.  Post a guard, and send 
		the men back.  Keep the "droid" 
		here with the ship; we'll let the 
		scavenger crew take care of him, 
		too.</sp>

<sd>The troops begin to file out of the ship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="69"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>A lone trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit.  
		In a few moments, all is quiet.  The muffled sounds of a 
		distant officer giving orders finally fade.  A sharp tapping 
		can be heard very near, and a panel on a row of low cabinets 
		crashes to the floor.  Han Solo's head pokes out of the 
		hole and looks around the hallway.  He then pulls himself 
		out of his cramped quarters and struts around, stretching 
		his legs.  A second locker breaks open and Luke emerges.  
		Chewbacca pokes his furry head out of the first locker and 
		Han tells him the way is clear.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		This is ridiculous.  I tell you 
		it's not going to work. Montross 
		is crazed half the time...</sp>

<sd>Luke straightens himself out as Montross appears in his
		locker.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="70"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - LOUNGE AREA</setting>

<sd>Luke, Han, Montross, Chewbacca, and little Artoo quietly
		make their way down a hallway to the lounge area, where
		four Imperial troopers stand guard.  Luke peeks around the 
		doorway, then whispers to Han.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		There are only four.  Remember:
		Quietly, and don't mess up the 
		uniforms...</sp>

<sd>Han repeats this to Chewbacca and they both grin with ex-
		cited, determined looks on their faces.  Luke gives the 
		signal as the Wookiee and the young Corellian pirate charge 
		past him with their laser swords held high, screaming like 
		wild banshees.  Luke is somewhat confused by the attack.
		The yelling and the clash of swords echo throughout the 
		ship.  Montross holds his ears.  Artoo runs and joins up 
		with the shackled Threepio.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="71"><setting>  INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER</setting>

<sd>In the main control tower, next to the starship, a gantry
		officer looks up from his desk, as if he hears something.
		He turns to an aide who is busy readjusting a monitor.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GANTRY OFFICER</speaker>
		Did you hear that?</sp>

<sd>The aide shakes his head; but the officer, convinced that
		he heard something, leaves the control tower and heads for 
		the pirate ship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="72"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - LOUNGE AREA</setting>

<sd>The gantry officer cautiously enters the pirate starship
		with his laser pistol drawn.  Everything is quiet in the
		lounge area.  Two guards sit at a table with a third stand-
		ing over them.  The fourth guard approaches the gantry 
		officer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GUARD</speaker>
		You have business here?</sp>

<sd>The guard is Han Solo.  He struggles to hide a large blood 
		stain under his right arm.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		I thought I heard something down 
		here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Are you sure it was from down here?
		We didn't hear anything...</sp>

<sd>The gantry officer shakes his head at the puzzlement.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		Well, I guess not...but keep your 
		eyes open...</sp>

<sd>The guard standing at the table is Luke; and as he turns to 
		glance at the gantry officer, one of the guards sitting at 
		the table topples over and lands with his face on the floor.  
		The gantry officer raises his pistol and immediately becomes 
		suspicious.  An embarrassed grin breaks out on Luke and Han's 
		faces.  With a swiftness rivaling a Jedi prince, Han knocks 
		the gun from the gantry officer's hand and decks him.  Luke 
		runs over to help Han, and Montross, Chewbacca and the robots 
		rush in.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Don't mess him up!</sp>

<sd>Han starts to change jackets with the gantry officer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I've just been promoted.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		All right now, you don't have 
		much time.  I hope you can re-
		member everything.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		We'll be back before you know 
		it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Just have the ship ready.</sp>

<sd>Luke binds the huge Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.  The
		Wookiee has a worried and slightly frightened look on his
		face.  Han reassures him, straightens his jacket and they
		start off into the giant Imperial city of Alderaan.  Han
		and Luke walk on either side of the giant Chewbacca and
		Artoo and Threepio reluctantly follow along behind.
		Montross stays aboard the starship and carefully and
		quietly closes the hatch.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="73"><setting>  INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER</setting>

<sd>A lone aide is quietly working on a monitor when Chewbacca, 
		the huge Wookiee, appears in the doorway with a bone-chilling 
		howl.  A look of surprise, awe, and sheer dread crosses 
		the aide's face as he stumbles over his tools.  The Wookiee 
		flattens him with one blow.  Threepio and Artoo waddle into 
		the room, followed by Han and Luke guarding the rear.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Must he howl so?  Every Sith in 
		the city will know we're here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Good!  I prefer a straight fight 
		to all this sneaking around.</sp>

<sd>Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel, until Artoo 
		finds something which gets him excited.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		We've found it, sir.  Bless the 
		maker, this control board has one.</sp>

<sd>Han and Luke rush over to the robots.  Chewbacca busies
		himself with hanging the control aide by his toes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Plug him in.Let's see what 
		we get.</sp>

<sd>Artoo punches his claw arm into a computer socket, and the 
		vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding informa-
		tion to the little robot.  After a few moments, he beeps 
		something to Threepio.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Level five, Detention block A-23, 
		cell 2187... He's still alive...
		but his condition is reported as 
		critical.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		All right, wait for us here...
		Send feed-back into the control 
		sensors in that Detention block 
		only.</sp>

<sd>Han puts the electronic bonds back on Chewbacca and the
		trio starts out the door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Pardon me for asking, sir...but, 
		ah...what are we to do if someone 
		should discover us here?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Hope they don't have blasters.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		That isn't very reassuring.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="74"><setting>INT. DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE - IMPERIAL CITY OF ALDERAAN</setting>

<sd>Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous, as they wait for a 
		vacuum elevator to arrive.  Troops and bureaucrats bustle 
		about ignoring the trio completely; only a few give the 
		giant Wookiee a curious glance.  Finally, a small elevator 
		arrives, and the trio enter.  A bureaucrat races to get 
		aboard also, but is signaled away by Han.  The door to the 
		pod-like vehicle slides closed, and it takes off through a 
		vacuum tube.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		This is the PT-27 unit that ceases 
		operation if there is any kind of

<sd>He rubs his hand across a series of small holes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Gas...Montross was definitely 
		right.  If they discover us,

<sd>Han gives him a skeptical look.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="75"><setting>  INT. DETENTION AREA - DUNGEON</setting>

<sd>The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old, gray
		security station.  Guards and laser gates are everywhere.
		Han whispers to Luke under his breath.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		This isn't going to work.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Why didn't you say so before.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I think I did.</sp>

<sd>A tall, grim-looking officer approaches the trio.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		What code is this?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I've got it here somewhere...
		It's SPT 188544.  You can check 
		it through the...ahh, oh yes, 
		lex-321.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		It will take a while -- the big 
		mode is acting up...getting feed-
		back from somewhere.</sp>

<sd>The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
		the information.  There are only three other troopers in 
		the area.  Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all 
		of the alarms, laser gates and camera eyes.  Han unfastens 
		one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		May THE FORCE OF OTHERS be with us.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly, Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with
		one of his ear-piercing howls.  He grabs Han's laser sword 
		and ignites it, pushing Han against the wall.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Look out!  He's loose!</sp>

<sd>The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded.  Luke and 
		Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
		blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee.  Their barrage of 
		laser fire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
		gate controls, and the Imperial guards.  The officer is the 
		last to fall under the laser fire just as he starts to push 
		the alarm system.  Luke rushes over to the com-link system, 
		which is screeching questions about what is going on.  Han 
		and Chewbacca disappear down one of the sub-hallways.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		A Wookiee broke loose up here, 
		but we've got him under control.
		There is a lot of damage, four 
		casualties.  The main door jammed.
		Better keep the rescue squad away 
		from here, we've got some fires...</sp>

<sd>He blasts some of the furniture with his laser pistol and it

<scene n="76"><setting>  INT. DUNGEON - CELL ROW</setting>

<sd>Han and Chewbacca race down the rows of low, stone-cell doors.  
		Han stops before cell 2187 and yells something to Chewbacca, 
		who covers his face as the young pirate blasts the door away 
		with his laser pistol.  When the smoke clears, Han looks in 
		the cell and an expression of horror crosses his face.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		"Holy Maker" No!</sp>

<sd>Suspended inside the cell by invisible rays, a bloody and
		mutilated Deak Starkiller hangs upside down.  A strange
		yellow glow radiates from his eyes.  Chewbacca rushes into 
		the cell past the dazed Han.  The Wookiee yells something 
		and Han comes to, firing his pistol at a small control box 
		in the wall.  The unconscious Deak drops like a rock into 
		the giant Wookiee's arms.  Chewbacca slings him over his 
		shoulders, and joins Han in the hallway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="77"><setting>  INT. DETENTION AREA - DUNGEON</setting>

<sd>Smoke fills the small control center as Luke fiddles with
		the wires on the control board.</sd>

<sd>A series of explosions at the main doorway knock a hole in 
		the wall through which several Imperial troops begin to 
		emerge.  Luke fires his laser pistol at them through the 
		smoke and flames.  He turns and runs down a sub-hallway, 
		stopping only for a moment on the far side of the passage-
		way to lock on the laser gate "cutters".  He takes a small 
		com-link transmitter from his belt and speaks into it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<scene n="78"><setting>  INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL T0WER</setting>

<sd>Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and

		link transmitter.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I said, all systems have been
		alerted to your presence, sir.
		I respectfully suggest you re-
		turn at once...</sp>

<sd>The transmitter squawks a short reply, and Threepio peeks
		out the tower window at the starship.  All is quiet.  He
		then moves to the door and it slides open a crack.  Several 
		troops rush past, yelling and shouting orders.  Threepio 
		slams the door shut, and pushes the lock lever.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Oh no!</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="79"><setting>  INT. DUNGEON - CELL ROW</setting>

<sd>Han and Chewbacca rush toward the detention control complex, 
		but are met by Luke running toward them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		There's no going back that way.</sp>

<sd>Luke notices his mutilated brother draped over Chewbacca's 
		shoulders.  His mouth drops open in stunned shock.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		He's still with us, but there 
		ain't much left of him.
		Your family must have something 
		the Empire wants awfully bad.</sp>

<sd>The trio turns and runs down the cell block passageway.
		They reach a small grate in the wall, covering a passage
		that leads down into a deep darkness.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		This way.  It might lead out of 
		the cell block.</sp>

<sd>Luke and Han pull up the rusty grate, and they disappear
		into the black passageway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="80"><setting>  INT. DUNGEON - PASSAGEWAY</setting>

<sd>Han leads the group down the ever-darkening, narrow passage-
		way.  Their footsteps echo on the cold stone steps of the 
		winding, descending stairway.  Han and Luke switch on small 
		lights in their gunbelts.  The rhythmic marching of storm-
		troops is heard behind them.  Han stops the group before 
		an intersecting hallway.  The marching troops seem to be 
		getting louder; muffled voices can be heard.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		They're right behind us.  Which 
		way?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Your guess is as good as mine.
		Maybe we'd better keep going 
		down until we reach the docking 
		level...</sp>

<sd>They continue down the eerie, slimy corridor that gets nar-
		rower and narrower as they descend into the bowels of the 
		city.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="81"><setting>  INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER</setting>

<sd>A loud buzzer sounds throughout the control tower.  Threepio 
		rushes to the computer console.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		All right, all right, I'm going 
		to answer it...just don't blame 
		me if we get caught.</sp>

<sd>He switches on the control com-link.</sd>

<sp><speaker>COM-LINK</speaker>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Confirmed, and out.
(to Artoo)
		Do you think they'll believe that?</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="82"><setting>  INT. DUNGEON - PASSAGEWAY</setting>

<sd>The passageway has gotten so small that Han, Luke and
		Chewbacca must walk sideways.  Suddenly the way opens up to 
		a wide, low ceiling corridor that is very dark and dank.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		We made it...Hurry!</sp>

<sd>The group runs along the foul-smelling passageway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I think they've stopped following 
		us.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I wonder why?...It's sure getting 
		hot down here.  Where do you think 
		this leads?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		It's some kind of vent system.</sp>

<sd>A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the
		far end of the passageway and stops the group dead in its
		tracks.  They exchange rather worried looks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I think I know why they stopped 
		following us...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Which direction is it?</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca jabbers something to Han.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Chewbacca says there are legends 
		of the Sith keeping DAI NOGAS in 
		the belly of the city...Dai Nogas 
		are not to be trifled with.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Which way should we go?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		They are not natural creatures.
		They are very large; but it 
		could be anywhere.  There is no 
		hope for us back there, so I 
		guess we should push ahead.</sp>

<sd>They start forward; but the giant Wookiee stops and howls
		something at Han.  The young captain talks to the frightened 
		creature and eventually calms him down, and they slowly con-
		tinue forward.  Barely perceivable, a dim light glimmers at 
		the far end of the hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Look, a light, head for it!</sp>

<sd>The group picks up speed as it nears the light.  Suddenly, 
		a huge form blocks out the light, and Chewbacca lets out a 
		terrified howl and begins to back away.  Han and Luke stand 
		fast with their laser pistols drawn.  Han calls back to the 
		Wookiee, who begins to cower near one of the damp walls.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Guns are no good.  Only a Jedi, 
		strong with the FORCE, can stop 
		it.</sp>

<sd>The huge shape, breathing loud and deep, sloshes forward.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Maybe we could out-flank it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		The passageway is too small...We 
		would have to distract it with 
		something.</sp>

<sd>The two boys begin to slowly walk backwards as the horrible 
		DAI NOGA begins its cumbersome advance.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Get Chewbacca, try to get around 
		it.  I'll draw it away.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Are you sure??  These things 
		aren't natural.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'll listen to your plan...</sp>

<sd>Han turns and rushes back to Chewbacca, who is huddled
		against the wall, with the unconscious Deak lying by his
		side.  The Wookiee is shaking and wailing like a small
		child.  In the thin light provided by the small door at
		the end of the passageway, the faint outline of the grue-
		some Dai Noga can be perceived.  Luke, with shaking hands, 
		fires directly at the center of the beast.  His laser bolt 
		passes through the huge creature and explodes against a 
		far wall.  The light from the blast reveals a little more 
		of the thing, which is something like a cross between a 
		huge spider and a giant squid.</sd>

<sd>Han has blindfolded Chewbacca, and attempts to lead the
		Wookiee carrying Deak around the terrifying Dai Noga.
		They edge their way along the corridor wall as Luke fires
		a second blast at the slime.  The Dai Noga lets out with
		a horrible moan and lumbers towards Luke with a new vigor.  
		Luke backs away firing as he goes.  Han and Chewbacca make 
		it to the door and watch the Dai Noga move after Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		We're clear!  I'll distract him.</sp>

<sd>He fires a shot at the monster, but it continues after Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Shoot above him!</sp>

<sd>Han fires again, this time above the creature, knocking
		rocks and debris on top of him.  He turns to face his new
		enemy, enabling Luke to creep around the Dai Noga and join 
		Han and Chewbacca.  The spider-like monster lets out a
		moan and leaps at the two youths.  Chewbacca has worked 
		loose the iron grate covering the doorway, and the group 
		tumbles into a dusty, unused hallway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="83"><setting>  INT. DUNGEON - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>The Dai Noga bangs against the opening and a long slimy
		tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a
		victim.  Han aims his pistol.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		No, wait!!  They'll hear...</sp>

<sd>Han fires at the doorway, creating an avalanche of rubble
		which buries the monster.</sd>

<sd>The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the
		passageway.  Luke simply shakes his head at the young cap-
		tain.  They get up and start down the passageway.  Han is 
		clearly bothered by Luke's low opinion of his actions.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I don't care, I want them to 
		find us...I need a good fight...
		I could polish off a whole squad, 
		like that!</sp>

<sd>He snaps his fingers as Luke gives him a skeptical look.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="84"><setting>  INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER</setting>

<sd>Threepio nervously paces the control room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		You mean they've calculated that 
		the escape has something to do 
		with the ship!  Then they'll come 
		up here, too...Oh me! We'll all 
		be atomized.  Where could they 
		have disappeared to?</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="85"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - PASSAGEWAY</setting>

<sd>Luke and Han stand before a bay window overlooking the pi-
		rate starship.  They watch as a platoon of Imperial storm-
		troopers take up guard positions outside the craft.  An 
		officer attempts to open the hatch and enter the ship, but 
		is unsuccessful.  He exits the docking bay in a hurry.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		He'll be heading for the control 
		tower.  Come on...</sp>

<sd>The two boys rush down the hallway, followed by the lumber-
		ing Chewbacca carrying Deak.  They round a corner and run 
		smack dab into twelve Imperial stormtroopers heading toward 
		them.  Both groups are taken by surprise, and stop in their 
		tracks.  Before even thinking, Han draws his laser sword 
		and charges the troops, yelling at the top of his lungs.
		The troops are startled by this assault and start to back 
		off.  Han manages to cut several down before the rest flee		
		in panic.  Pleased with his prowess, Han starts after them, 
		yelling back to Luke as he goes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Get Chewbacca to the ship!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Wait, where are you going?  Come 
		back here!</sp>

<sd>Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.  Luke
		rushes Chewbacca to the doorway at the end of the hallway.
		He motions the Wookiee to go on.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="86"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - SUB-HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>Han chases the ten stormtroopers down a long sub-hallway.
		He is yelling and brandishing his laser sword.  The troops 
		reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight.  Han 
		stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position.
		He is ready to cut them down.  The troops begin to ignite 
		their laser swords; soon all ten troopers are moving into 
		an attack position in front of the lone star pirate. Han's 
		determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to ad-
		vance.</sd>

<sd>Luke runs down the sub-hallway in a last-ditch attempt to
		save his bold friend.  Suddenly he hears the clamor of
		laser swords and yelling.  Around the corner shoots Han
		Solo, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed 
		by a host of furious stormtroopers.  Luke turns and starts 
		running the other way, also.  They run around several cor-
		ners, and the troops drop a ways behind.  Luke squeezes 
		down a side passage and signals for Han to follow.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="87"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - NARROW PASSAGE</setting>

<sd>Luke and Han run down the narrow passageway looking for an 
		exit.  The stormtroopers can be heard barking orders as 
		they follow the duo.  An officer at the far end of the hall-
		way spots them and fires a laser blast at them, but misses.  
		They reach a complex blast-shield door which they attempt 
		to open by pushing a series of buttons on a lock switch.
		The several layers of hatches and locks slowly peel away.
		Han returns the laser fire of the gathered stormtroopers 
		at the end of the hallway.  The signal on their belt com-
		links begins to buzz.  Luke takes one in hand and gets a 
		jumble of excited Wookiee gibberish.  He hands the small 
		com-link receiver to Han, who continues his barrage of the 
		troopers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		It's for you.</sp>

<sd>Han talks to the Wookiee and seems to be in some kind of
		an argument.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="88"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - MAIN FORWARD BAY</setting>

<sd>Chewbacca is crouched behind some supply cannisters near
		the main entrance to the spaceport bay.  Stormtroopers
		march to and fro in front of the pirate starship.  The
		giant Wookiee whispers into the com-link.  Deak lies in a
		heap at his feet.  Chewbacca ducks lower as several troops 
		stop almost on top of him.  He puts the com-link back on 
		his belt and draws Deak close to him.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="89"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - NARROW PASSAGE</setting>

<sd>Han gives the com-link back to Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Chewbacca can't make it to the 
		ship without help.</sp>

<sd>The final hatch starts to swing open behind them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Then let's go!</sp>

<sd>They turn and start into the main spaceport causeway.  A
		few feet into the hallway and the boys stop short.  Two
		evil, BLACK KNIGHTS OF THE SITH stride toward them.  Luke
		turns and runs back into the narrow passageway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Come on back.  We'll not be 
		stopping them...</sp>

<sd>Han jumps back into the narrow passageway and Luke pulls
		the main blast-shield lock switch.  The five layers of
		door instantly slam shut.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Now what??</sp>

<sd>Luke shrugs his shoulders.  The stormtroopers renew their
		assault.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="90"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - MAIN CAUSEWAY</setting>

<sd>The two Sith knights stop before the huge blast-shield door.
		Stormtroopers take up position behind them.  One of the 
		knights turns to the first officer of the guard.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SITH KNIGHT</speaker>
		Move your man back.</sp>

<sd>The troops scurry out of the way, as the Sith knights raise 
		their arms over their heads, creating a powerful force field.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="91"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - NARROW PASSAGE</setting>

<sd>The mighty blast-shield door bulges under the pressure of
		the Sith para-force.  Luke spots a small waste receptacle
		on the wall.  He fires a few shots at the assembled storm-
		troopers at the far end of the corridor, and moves to the 
		garbage chute.  He motions for Han to follow, but the young 
		starcaptain is sitting in a corner staring blankly at the 
		bulging door.  Luke runs back to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		What is it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		It's no use...we're lost.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		No, no, there's a debris chute.
		It's the Bogan force making you 
		feel that way.  Don't give up 
		hope...fight it!</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		It's no use, it's no use.</sp>

<sd>The giant hinge bolts on the blast-shield door begin to pop 
		as the force of the Sith knights grows stronger.  Luke fires 
		off a rapid series of shots and half-drags Han to the small 
		grate in the wall.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Well, we're going anyway.  Think 
		of good things.  Drive the Bogan 
		from your mind.</sp>

<sd>Luke blasts the cover off the debris receptacle and shoves 
		Han into the small opening.  The giant blast door begins 
		to smolder, creating a smoky cover for the boys to hide in.  
		Luke frantically blasts away at the advancing stormtroopers, 
		then climbs into the garbage chute and disappears.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="92"><setting>  INTERIOR SPACEPORT - GARBAGE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Luke slides through a series of chutes until he winds up
		in a large room full of muck.  Han is already stumbling
		around looking for an exit.  He finds a small hatchway and 
		struggles to get it open.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		The blasted thing is vacuum-
		sealed.</sp>

<sd>He draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch.  The laser 
		bolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  Both 
		Luke and Han dive for cover in the garbage as the bolt ex-
		plodes almost on top of them.  Luke climbs out of the gar-
		bage with a rather grim look on his face.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'm glad to see the Bogan is no 
		longer with you, but would you 
		put that thing away or you're 
		going to get us both killed.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
(sarcastic)
		I'll leave it for you to open 
		then.  I'm just afraid we're 
		going to have company soon...
		This is a brilliant escape.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Well, it could be worse...</sp>

<sd>Before Han can reply, the walls of the garbage receptacle
		begin to rumble and edge toward the adventurers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Now what?!?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Try to jam it with something.</sp>

<sd>They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
		walls; but they are simply snapped and bent and the giant
		trash masher rumbles on.  The situation doesn't look good.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		This isn't working!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Well then, think of something 
		else!</sp>

<sd>The room gets smaller and smaller, until it is only three
		feet wide.  Garbage is snapping and popping as it is crushed 
		by the relentless walls.  Luke's com-link begins to buzz, 
		and he pulls it off his belt.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I begging your pardon, sir,
		but we are going to be unable 
		to stay here much longer.
		Could you give us...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
(to Han)
		Threepio!  That's it.  The R-2 
		unit is still plugged into the 
		control systems...
(into the
com-link)
		Threepio, listen to me.  Have 
		Artoo shut down all garbage 
		chutes in the immediate con-
		necting bays.  I think we're 
		on your level, but shut them 
		off on the level above you, 
		also...Quickly, shut them off!</sp>

<sd>The rumbling walls begin to shake the room, and then they
		halt.  Han breathes a sigh of relief.  Luke goes over to
		the pressure hatch and scrapes some muck off a number.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Open the pressure maintenance 
		hatch on unit 366117891...</sp>

<sd>In a moment, the door pops open.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE  (CONT'D)</speaker>
		We're out.  Disconnect Artoo and 
		go back to the ship...Avoid the 
		troops, if possible...</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I wish you were here, sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		We'll be with you shortly.  In-

<scene n="93"><setting>  INT. SPACEPORT - GANTRY HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>Two Imperial officers stand in the hallway leading to the

		believe their eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		That's them!</sp>

<sd>Before they can do anything about it, Han and Luke jump
		the officers from behind, and put laser swords to their

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Thank goodness you're safe,

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Chewbacca's got him.  Now if we

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>

<sd>Han and Luke, dragging their hostages in front of them,
		enter the starship bay.  Artoo and Threepio hurry in be-

		train their weapons on the group, but seeing an admiral 
		held as hostage, hesitate.  Chewbacca jumps out from be-
		hind the supply cannisters, carrying Deak over his shoulder, 
		and joins the group.  They slowly make their way toward 
		the starship, which is a medley of noises, as it prepares 
		for take-off.  The main hatch slides open.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		Forget about us -- fire on them.</sp>

<sd>The troops aim their laser rifles.  The admiral panics.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ADMIRAL</speaker>
		No, wait!  Don't shoot!  They'll

<sd>Montross pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS (over head-phones) </speaker>
        Here they come.</sp>

<sd>Han jumps into the turret opposite Luke, and begins to strap 
		himself in.  The pirate starship shudders as the Imperial 
		fighters open fire.  Luke's turret swings around and he be-
		gins to return the fire.  Moments later, Han lowers his 
		glare reflector and with a burst of smoke and electrical 
		charge also opens up on the enemy craft.  One of the Imperial 
		fighters is hit by a concentrated barrage and begins spin-
		ning out of control, until it finally explodes.  Han gives 
		Luke a victory wave, which Luke gleefully returns.</sd>

<sd>Imperial fighters buzz about everywhere.  The constant flash-
		ing of deflected laser bolts reflect in the interior of the 
		turret bubble.  Chewbacca sits in an aft turret, blazing 
		away at the enemy craft.  A huge explosion rocks the pirate 
		ship and throws Artoo and Threepio crashing against a pas-
		sageway wall.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Here we go again.  How did we

<sd>Over the com-link, Montross gives instructions as to the

<sd>Several of the Imperial fighters concentrate their fire on 
		a weakened port antenna and finally it explodes, opening 
		a hole in one of the compartments and everything that isn't 
		bolted down is sucked into outer space.  Threepio and Artoo 
		struggle to push a large cabinet in front of the hole.</sd>

<sd>The cockpit is alive with warning lights and buzzers, but

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		You're doing great, boys. There

<sd>Montross pulls back on several of the levers before him,

		to the Jedi's gaping wounds.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I don't know much more we can do 
		for him, sir.  These are spiritual 
		wounds.  The Bogan arts often run 
		contrary to the ways of science...

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<sd>Han simply shakes his head at the situation.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		He must have something of great

		A lost spice mine, maybe?  Well,

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		You've done well, Threepio...you

		him for awhile, would you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is

<sd>Threepio turns and leaves, locking the cabin door behind
him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (CONT'D)</speaker>

		just can't...What am I going to do?
		Just tell me what to do...Oh, Deak!</sp>

<sd>Luke slumps over his brother and begins to weep quietly.  
Suddenly he remembers the Kiber Crystal hidden in his belt.</sd>

<sd>He takes off his belt and fumbles to open the secret com-
partment.  The buckle snaps open and a powerful clear light 
fills the darkened room.  The Kiber Crystal's glow is al-
most blinding.  Luke takes the supernatural gem and places 
it in his injured brother's hand.  Luke suddenly sits bolt 
upright.  A thought seems to come to him and he dashes 
out of the cabin.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<sd>Luke slams a connector panel on the computer console.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
(getting more 
excited)
		We have MORE than enough power to

<sd>Montross starts to bring his arm down across the computer 
console to make his point, but Han grabs it in time to 
keep it from being dashed to bits.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		It's not a wasteland.  There is

<sd>A sing-song alarm goes off on the scanner console.  Threepio, 
who has been quietly sitting in the co-pilot's seat all 
through the argument, interrupts his master.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Excuse me, sir -- but we seem

<sd>Montross looks into the scanner display.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		I don't think that's a ship,

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		A station of some kind?</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>

<sd>Two small lifepods jettison away from the starship, and
slowly drift toward the awesome, deep green surface of
the moon.  Retro-rockets automatically kick in and slow
the pods.  The two tiny craft break through some light
cloud cover and land in the dense, steaming jungles of
Yavin's fourth moon.</sd>

<scene n="107"><setting>  EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - VINE JUNGLE</setting>

<sd>One of the lifepods has come to rest in the middle of a bog.</sd>

<sd>Han, Chewbacca, and Threepio emerge from the battered cap-
sule as it slowly sinks into the murky swamp.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Montross was sure right about

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		They landed further south, I

<sd>Chewbacca inspects a huge laser weapon and straps several 
power packs to his bandoliers.  The group ventures into a 
forest of gargantuan trees shrouded in an eerie mist. The 
air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable 
creatures.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="108"><setting>  EXT. VINE JUNGLE</setting>

<sd>Luke's lifepod is caught in the limbs of a huge tree.  The 
fragile craft has been ripped in half by the crash land-
ing.  A glass-enclosed mummy case containing the wounded 
Deak Starkiller is securely strapped in what remains of 
the tiny lifepod.  But his unconscious brother, Luke, hangs 
half out of the damaged craft.  A two-foot high insect-
like creature scoots down a branch and onto the back of 
the dormant warrior.  The insect lets out a chilling his-
sing sound, and a slimy tube emerges from its hairy mouth, 
waking Luke.  He opens his eyes, but doesn't move.  He is 
immediately aware of the insect.  Suddenly, with one quick 
blow, he knocks the creature against the side of the life-
pod, and it is squashed lifeless.</sd>

<sd>Luke is a little groggy, but he manages to climb out of the 
wreckage.  He hears a frantic whistle, pathetic in its 
desperation.  Luke looks around and spots Artoo hanging up-
side down, one of his three feet caught in a vine.  Luke 
lifts the stubby robot out of his predicament and places 
him securely on a wide limb.  Luke then attaches a thin 
cable from his utility belt to the tree trunk, and slides 
to the ground.  Han and Threepio are waiting for him at 
the base of the huge tree.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Are you all right?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Yeah, I think so.  I'm going 
		to need some help getting Deak 
		down from there.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca emerges from the dense foliage and tells Han
something.  He tells Chewbacca to climb the tree and get
Deak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		He says we're about a league off 
		the coordinates.  The going will 
		be slow in this mess...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Then we best get on with it.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="109"><setting>  EXT. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE</setting>

<sd>Gruesome and unnatural sounds permeate this ghostly waste-
land.  The jungle is a strange and eerie, fog-laden purga-
tory.  The group stops on a ridge overlooking the rebel 
outpost of MASASSI.  All that can be seen of the fortress 
is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out 
above the dense jungle.  Suddenly, three Aquillian rangers 
break out of the dark foliage and approach the group. Han 
and Chewbacca raise their weapons.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Hold!  Who are you?  Whom do 
		you serve?</sp>

<sd>One of the rangers strides forward, ignoring Han's laser
pistol.  He is a tall man; on his helmet is the crest of
AQUILLAE.  He advances until he is standing a few feet
from Luke's weapon.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		I am Bail Antilles...I serve 
		THE FORCE OF OTHERS...We are 
		agents of the Starkiller...He 
		has been expecting you...</sp>

<sd>Han looks a little puzzled, but lowers his weapon and tells 
Chewbacca to do likewise.  About two dozen rangers emerge 
from the brush and take up positions around the group. One 
of them speaks to Chewbacca in his own tongue, and the 
giant Wookiee lowers Deak onto a stretcher they have placed 
before him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES (CONT'D)</speaker>
		Which of you is young Luke?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I am.  This is my friend and a 
		great starcaptain, Han Solo...
		His first mate is called Chewbacca.</sp>

<sd>Antilles bows low before Luke.  The young adventurer is
embarrassed and doesn't know how to respond.  Finally the 
ranger rises.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		We must move swiftly, my lord.
		For you have arrived with all of 
		the force of the Bogan at your 
		heels.  The Death Star has found

<scene n="110"><setting>  EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASASSI OUTPOST</setting>

<sd>Luke, Han, Chewbacca, the robots and Aquillian rangers ride 
on top of a low, gray armored transport speeder.  They swing 
past a long line of gleaming spacefighters sitting along 
the edge or the vast jungle runway.  The several different 
types of two-man fighter craft have a wide variety of mark-
ings.  Several of the ships have bizarre and colorful de-
signs painted across their large deflector fins, which trans-
forms the crafts into huge and grotesque creatures, while 
others create beautiful and unique mosaic patterns.  Ground 
crews rush about servicing the craft.  Activity is at a 
fever pitch as Luke, Han and Antilles disembark the speeder 
and enter a low metal building to one side of the runway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="111"><setting>  INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM</setting>

<sd>The war room is a mass of glass enclosures, electronic wall 
displays, monitors and computer stations.  Officers and 
aides rush to and fro, ignoring Luke and Han as they follow 
Major Antilles to a large, dimly lit conference room domi-
nated by a huge galactic display board.  A briefing is in 
progress.  Several dozen officers sit around a long table 
as a young astro-general named DODANA is describing an
attack plan to the others.  Antilles stops Han just outside 
the door as two braided guards approach them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		You'll have to wait here.</sp>

<sd>Han gives Luke a look of betrayal and anger.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I'll be back, and you'll be 
		paid.</sp>

<sd>Luke follows Antilles into the conference room and a glass 
door slides silently closed behind them.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="112"><setting>  INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - CONFERENCE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Antilles and Luke sit in chairs at the back of the room.  
Several officers at the table glance at Luke, but for the
most part their attention remains riveted on General Dodana.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODANA</speaker>
		...and although the digital
		analysis doesn't confirm it,
		he feels there is a weak point...</sp>

<sd>Several large projections of a huge, armored space station 
appear behind Dodana.  One angle shows the north pole of 
the complex globe.  Six black towers dominate the detailed 
portion of the sphere.  Antilles whispers something to 
Luke who answers with a question.  Antilles points to a 
dark corner of the room near Dodana.  Luke strains to see 
something in the corner.  His hand fingers his belt buckle 
and he turns to Antilles and nods yes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODANA (CONT'D)</speaker>
		...Here, near the north pole
		someplace.  In an area somewhere 
		below their generating towers, 
		he predicts you'll find a small 
		thermal exhaust port.  It is an 
		unshielded shaft that runs di-
		rectly into the reactor system.
		A direct hit straight into the 
		shaft would set up a chain reac-
		tion that would destroy the Death 
		Star.</sp>

<sd>A large, sallow-eyed General named AAY ZAVOR fiddles ner-
vously with a small hand computer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ZAVOR</speaker>
		The greatest concentration of 
		fire power is at the poles.  I 
		doubt a ship could get in there 
		to find the exhaust port, let 
		alone fire a direct hit down the 
		shaft...</sp>

<sd>A flight officer with a patch over one eye rises.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FLIGHT OFFICER</speaker>
		There is an impossible magnetic 
		field around those towers. Maneu-
		verability in that sector is less 
		than point three...</sp>

<sd>The GRANDE MOUFF TARKIN, a thin, bird-like commander of
the outland Kesselian Dragoons, stands, and Dodana sits
down, revealing behind and to one side of him a wizened
old man with long silver hair -- THE STARKILLER.  He is
apparently asleep; but as the Grande Mouff rises, the
Starkiller's crystal-clear eyes open knowingly.  An aura
of power radiates from the ancient Jedi that almost knocks 
Tarkin over.  The Starkiller is a large man, but shriveled 
and bent by an incalculable number of years.  His face, 
cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is set off by a 
long silver beard and penetrating gray-blue eyes.  Luke 
stares at him in awe.  He's at once proud, moved and 
slightly frightened.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker>
		With all due respect, sir, the time 
		has come for it to be said...</sp>

<sd>There is a long pause, as most of the officers on the Grande 
Mouff's side of the table look down at their fidgeting hands 
or nervously look away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN (CONT'D)</speaker>
		After our crushing defeat, and the 
		destruction of Ogana Major by this 
		Death Star...the Council has voted 
		to trust the cybormitic analysis 
		for future attack and planning pro-
		cedures.  Your contact with THE FORCE 
		OF OTHERS is weak to the point where 
		it can no longer be trusted.  This 
		new attack formula is contrary to 
		the cyborg plan and depends too much 
		on faith...a faith that deserted us 
		at Ogana Major.  Our blind, unwaver-
		ing faith in you and the Ashla has 
		led to our doom...</sp>

<sd>The Starkiller sits unmoved, unresponding.  Zavor jumps to 
his feet in great anger and despair.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ZAVOR</speaker>
		Your strategy destroyed us on 
		Ogana Major!  THE FORCE OF OTHERS 
		is no longer with us.  The Bogan 
		is too strong. This Death Star 
		is too strong!</sp>

<sd>Finally Antilles can stand it no longer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		The Bogan is already beginning 
		to work on you...Will you flee 
		like frightened children again, 
		only to be hunted down again, 
		until there is no place to hide.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ZAVOR</speaker>
		We were overwhelmed; his plan was 
		hopeless as this new plan of his 
		is hopeless...</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		You would trust a machine's logic 
		over THE FORCE OF OTHERS?  His son 
		brings us new faith...</sp>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker>
		His son brought us the Death Star...
		He has betrayed us!</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		He's brought us the Kiber Crystal!</sp>

<sd>The room falls silent.  The bent and broken Starkiller rises 
and Tarkin and Zavor immediately sit down.  He motions for 
Luke to join him at the head of the table.  Luke hurries 
to his father's side and hands him the Kiber Crystal. The 
Starkiller holds up the powerful stone and it radiates a 
brilliant light throughout the room.  Years seem to drop 
from the old man as the Kiber's force moves into his body.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		With the Crystal, I can hold off 
		the force of the Bogan...but when 
		its presence is revealed, the enemy 
		will stop at nothing to acquire it.
		...You will have to win the battle
		or lose everything...there will be 
		no retreat, no place to hide if the 
		Sith gain possession of the Crystal
		...finding the exhaust port is your
		only chance.
		You must have faith...THE FORCE 
		OF OTHERS is with you.</sp>

<sd>One of the younger officers stands up.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
		We'll find the port.</sp>

<sd>Several other officers stand, also.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SECOND OFFICER</speaker>
		I think my boys could get in 
		there -- they can hit it.</sp>

<sd>More officers and Generals join in until even Zavor and
Tarkin are standing.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker>
		It will be to the finish, then.
		This time, victory!</sp>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		You've done well, my son -- but 
		I'm afraid your trial has just 
		begun.  I had hoped we would 
		have more time, time enough for 
		you to learn the ways of the

<sd>Artoo and Threepio enter the room and bow low before their 
master and his father.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I trust your replacement parts 
		are satisfactory?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Most certainly, and your kindness 
		is greatly appreciated.
		I feel my capacities have doubled, 
		and if I do say so, Artoo is a 
		new unit.  I'd hardly know him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		You have served us well, and I 
		am releasing you from further 
		service.  You may rest and enjoy 
		your remaining years in tran-
		quillity...</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		If it's at all possible, sir, and 
		if it's all the same to you...no 
		disrespect intended...we'd rather 
		continue to serve Master Luke.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		The choice is yours.  Luke is truly
		fortunate.  Now go and have them 
		bring us this starcaptain who was 
		so helpful to you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I begging your pardon, sir, but 
		might I inquire after Master Deak?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		Deak is doing fine, but the Bogan 
		is still heavy with him and it will 
		be some time before he is himself 
		again.  Now be off with you.</sp>

<sd>They bow low and leave the room.  Antilles ushers Han into 
the office.  Antilles bows low before the Starkiller and 
his son.  Han feels quite awkward standing before the 
legendary galactic hero.  He gives the old man a short 
bow, then gives Luke a slight nod.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKlLLER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		You have been of great service to 
		us.  We offer you this in gratitude.
		Luke tells me you have a great de-
		sire for such things.</sp>

<sd>He hands the young starcaptain a small box containing many 
neatly minted chrome bars.  Han's mouth drops open in amaze-
ment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		This must be at least seven or 
		eight million!</sp>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		I would that I could give you 
		more.  We sorely need a man of 
		your ability.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I'm afraid my calling is elsewhere.
		Sorry, Luke, but I'm not a part of 
		this.</sp>

<sd>Luke bows his head and is clearly disappointed.  He steps 
forward and gives Han a gray gunbelt with a chrome laser 
sword attached.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Han, I want you to take this.
		It was fashioned by the Bomerwrights
		of Sullest.  It is a special blade 
		with great power that will never 
		fail you.  Take care, my friend.</sp>

<sd>He gives Han a hug, and the young starcaptain leaves.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>

<sd>Han and Chewbacca enter the starship and are greeted by
Montross.  Han gives him the box of chrome bars.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Eight million!  Eight million 
		and we got it legal.  Can you 
		beat that?  If only Captain Oxus 
		could see us now.  He never had 
		a haul this big!</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		You didn't stay long.  Could you 
		have tried for more?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		That station we spotted is what 
		destroyed Ogana Major. They're 
		going to try to stop it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		Then I'd better get us going.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Yeah, do that.</sp>

<sd>Han has a wistful look in his eyes as Montross heads back 
to the cockpit.</sd>

<scene n="116"><setting>  INT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASASSI OUTPOST - READY ROOM</setting>

<sd>Chaos.  Red scramble lights are flashing.  Alert horns and 
attack buzzers create an unbelievable cacophony.  Star-
pilots in a variety of different style spacesuits scramble 
out of the low concrete ready room, grabbing helmets and 
space packs as they race out the doors.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="117"><setting>  EXT. MASASSI OUTPOST - ATTACK RUNWAY</setting>

<sd>Pilots and navigators dash in unison to a long line of wait-
ing two-man starship fighters.  Around it, crews scurry 
here and there loading last minute armament and unlocking 
power couplings.  Luke, closely followed by Artoo and 
Threepio, meet Antilles in front of one of the sleek star-
ships.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		This one's ours.  May THE FORCE 
		OF OTHERS be with us.</sp>

<sd>On a balcony overlooking the runway appears the dazzling
figure of the Starkiller.  His long silver hair and beard 
cascade over his flowing white robes.  The Kiber Crystal 
glitters in his right hand.  The pilots and crews stop 
what they are doing and bow low toward the honored Jedi.
Luke and the robots join the others in the tribute.  The 
air warriors are a wide mix of humans and other creatures 
from the many systems in the Alliance.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		Your next journey is marked by 
		your given word.
		Do not falter, for there is no 
		retreat from this battle.  The 
		power of the Bogan is strong on 
		the Death Star.  The Sith are 
		many, but we hold the one power 
		mightier than they: the Kiber 
		Crystal.  It is your captain and 
		your banner.  Do not fear to go 
		where it leads.  THE FORCE IS WITH 
		YOU.</sp>

<sd>The pilots and crews bow and hurry to their starships. Luke 
helps Threepio lift Artoo into the ship.  PILOT LEADER, a 
rugged, handsome man in his forties, gives his ground crew 
the signal that he is starting his ion engine.  He has a 
winning smile and a distinctive scar along the side of his 
face.  His crew chief pats him on the back.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
		Knock them all the way back to 
		Alderaan.</sp>

<sd>The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves onto 
the runway.  Luke and Antilles settle into their craft as 
their crew looks down the armament housing.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CREWMAN</speaker>
		I've got you about a thousand 
		pounds lighter.  It should help.</sp>

<sd>He hangs a small good-luck charm inside the cockpit as the 
main canopy starts to slide closed.  Luke and Antilles wave 
back to him.  Other crewmen say goodbye to their pilots, 
some grinning, some kidding -- all with a great deal of 
hidden emotion.  The din of retro-rockets cuts through the 
uproar, and six silver starships leave the runway and dis-
appear into the morning cloud cover.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="118"><setting>  INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM</setting>

<sd>The Starkiller sits quietly before a giant computer display 
of the Yavin system.  It shows the planet, moons and approach-
ing Death Star.  The Grande Mouff Tarkin stands behind the 
Jedi with several other Generals.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TARKIN</speaker>
		They're all away, sir.  For the 
		first time since the take-over,
		I feel real hope.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		Put their com-links through the 
		main system.  Let everyone hear 
it.</sp>

<sd>General Dodana approaches the group and leans over to the 
Starkiller.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODANA</speaker>
		They've made contact, sir.</sp>

<scene n="119"><setting>  EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN</setting>

<sd>A small bright speck orbiting the huge green moon of Yavin 
sparkles in the light of the distant sun.  Six rebel star 
ships settle ominously into the foreground, moving swiftly 
toward the orbiting speck.  As the starships move closer, 
the awesome size of the gargantuan Imperial space fortress 
is revealed.  Explosions create blinding flashes on the 
planet's surface as the Imperial fortress bombards the moon 
with a fusillade of laser bolts.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="120"><setting>  INT. LEAD STARSHIP - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>Pilot Leader, in the first ship, signals to his navigator 
who sits in a small isolated glass bubble to the rear of 
the craft.  The many monitors are filled with various com-
puter read-outs and displays.  Over the com-link one of 
the other starpilots reports to Pilot Leader.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOMA SIX (INTERCOM)</speaker>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER</speaker>

<scene n="121"><setting>  INT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>Luke adjusts the controls of the tiny starfighter and lowers 
the sunshade on his goggles.  Antilles and Threepio rotate 
around in the gun-pod.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Does that glare bother you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
		I wish they'd let us try for 
		that exhaust port.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="122"><setting>  EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - BATTLE</setting>

<sd>Fuel pods are jettisoned.  The starship fighters break off 
into a power-dive attack on the space fortress.  A barrage 
of laser fire from the huge fortress creates a wall of 
death, through which most of the rebel craft miraculously 
emerge, undamaged.  Multiple laser bolts streak from the 
starship fighters, creating small explosions on the complex 
surface of the fort.  Antilles directs his fire at one of 
the prime power terminals.  It explodes, generating weird 
electronic arcs that leap off the station's surface.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="123"><setting>  INT. IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS - MAIN STATION</setting>

<sd>Walls buckle and cave in, sucking debris and personnel into 
the vacuum of space.  Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scram-
ble to large turbo-powered laser gun emplacements.  Officers 
yell orders through the smoke and confusion.  Men and robots 
of various shapes and sizes run to their battle stations.  
Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and 
foreboding, is the evil Sith knight: Darth Vader.  Several 
astro-officers run up to him, still putting on the helmets 
and equipment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		Get to your ships.  I'll take the

</scene>
<scene n="124"><setting>  INT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM</setting>

<sd>Generals and troops listen silently to the action of the
starships over the com-link.  The Starkiller seems to be
asleep, but no one attempts to waken him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER (V.O.)</speaker>
		Boma One to Massoni Base, we're 
		nearing the north pole transmitter 
		area.  The magnetic concussion is 
		getting very rough.  We're start-
		ing our run.  Tighten it up.  Boma 
		Two, tighten it up.  Watch those

<sp><speaker>BOMA TWO (CHEWIE)(V.O.)</speaker>
		Heavy fire, Boss.  Twenty-three 
		degrees.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER (V.O.)</speaker>
		I see it.  Pull in.  Pull in.
		We're picking up some inter-
		ference.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOMA SIX (V.O.)</speaker>
		Wow, I've never seen such fire 
		power.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER (V.O.)</speaker>
		Pull in, Boma Two.  Pull in.
		Chewie, do you read me?  Chewie?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOMA TWO (V.O.)</speaker>
		I'm all right, Boss.  I've got 
		a target. I'm going in to check 
		it out.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOMA SIX (V.O.)</speaker>
		There is too much action, Chewie.
		Get out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER (V.O.)</speaker>
		Break off, Chewie.  Acknowledge.
		We've hit too much interference.
		Boma Six, can you see Boma Two?</sp>

<sd>The Starkiller's eyes open as the tension mounts.  He has 
not been asleep.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOMA SIX (V.O.)</speaker>
		I've lost him. There's a heavy 
		fire zone on this side.  My 
		scanner's jammed.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOMA FIVE (V.O.)</speaker>
		He's gone.  No, wait.  There he 
		is.  Fin damage, but he's all right.</sp>

<sd>A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room.  The computers 
flash off and then on again as the whole room shakes under 
the Death Star's bombardment of a nearby ridge.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DEVIL FOUR (V.O.)</speaker>
		Watch your back, Boss.  Watch 
		your back!  A TIE squad above 
		you, coming in -- about six ships.</sp>

<sd>125.  EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - BATTLE - REBEL
FIGHTERS (BOMA GROUP)</sd>

<sd>Six fin winged Imperial fighters dive on Pilot Leader, but 
he does a quick spiral turn and eludes them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOMA TWO (CHEWIE)(V.O.)</speaker>
		I found the exhaust port, Boss.
		Relay target six degrees south by 
		three mark two.  It's not very 
		big -- a direct hit is going to 
		be tough.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER</speaker>
		I copy, Boma Two, but we have other
		problems right now.</sp>

<sd>Pilot Leader and Boma Four dive in unison through a forest 
of radar domes, antennae and gun towers.  They are followed 
by four Imperial TIE fighters.  The two rebel ships make 
a sharp turn and come around behind the Imperial ships.
Boma Four and Pilot Leader fire into the TIE fighters as 
the six ships criss-cross the surface of the fortress.</sd>

<sd>Suddenly, a dense barrage of laser fire erupts from a pro-
truding tower, catching Boma Four broadside.  The rebel 
spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces.  Pilot 
Leader reacts to the loss of his wing man with a renewed 
attack on the Imperial ships -- one of which falls away 
and hits a prime power terminal, creating an arching spec-
tacle.  A chain reaction is set off, creating a series of 
explosions leaping across the surface of the fortress from 
terminal to terminal.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="126"><setting>  INT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - TRAVELING</setting>

<sd>Luke and three other speedy little fighters dart back and 
forth across the soft underbelly of the fortress, leaving 
a trail of destruction behind them.  Artoo is sitting on 
the seat-back above Threepio's shoulders.  He is beeping 
and whistling frantically.  Threepio swings his gun pod 
around and begins firing at an approaching Imperial TIE 
ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		I see it.  I see it.  Don't confuse 
		me, or we'll be killed.  See those?
		They break up in little pieces, just 
		like a GS unit under pressure.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		Luke, TIE fighters below us.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		I see them.  Hang on!</sp>

<sd>The rebel craft dives on the Imperial ships, all guns blast-
ing away.  Two of the TIE craft go down in flames.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="127"><setting>  INT. IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS - MAIN CONTROL CENTER</setting>

<sd>Constant explosions rock the interior of the fortress.
Troops scurry for safety in the panic-ridden control center.  
A Sith knight speaks to Lord Vader on the com-link.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SITH KNIGHT</speaker>
		Yes, my Lord, the Ashla Force is 
		strong upon us.  I can't hold the 
		panic.  How could it be?</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		I feel the influence of the Kiber 
		Crystal.  Perhaps the Starkiller 
		is still alive They must have 
		brought it out of hiding at last.
		We must strain -- counter the 
		force.  Their attack is organized; 
		they're going for the poles.  Con-
		centrate there.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="128"><setting>  EXT. REBEL STARSHIPS - BATTLE</setting>

<sd>Boma Two (Chewie), a young hot-shot of about sixteen years, 
miraculously dives his ship through a virtual sea of laser 
fire and blasts the Imperial fighters into dust.  Chewie 
signals to his navigator, who lets out a whooping cheer 
as the craft veers into a victory roll.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER</speaker>
		Great moves, Chewie.  Regroup at 
		point two-four.  Let's go in for 
		that exhaust port.  Coincide, Boma 
		Six.</sp>

<sd>Boma Five and Boma Three bob and weave in formation toward 
a group of giant towers at the north pole.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		I see it.  It looks good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOMA THREE</speaker>
		I've got it.  We're hit!  We're hit!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER</speaker>
		Eject...Eject.  Boma Three, do you
		read?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOMA THREE</speaker>
		I'm all right.  I can hold it.
		Give me a little room, Boma Five.
		Watch it!  Watch it!</sp>

<sd>Boma Three wobbles a little, then drops away sharply, plow-
ing into a huge laser gun emplacement, causing a hideous 
series of chain reaction explosions.  The four remaining 
starships of the Boma group fly in a tight formation and 
dive between the tall towers near the exhaust port.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER</speaker>
		Masassi Base, we're in position 
		and starting for the target.
		Chewie, hold your fire until 
		we're within point zero five 
		four.  Make it count.</sp>

<sd>Several ack-ack lasers begin to open fire on the approach-
ing spacecraft.  The rebel ships direct their fire at a 
small, glowing blue hole at the base of one of the towers.  
Boma Five explodes, quickly followed by Boma Four.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOMA TWO (CHEWIE)</speaker>
		I'm on it.</sp>

<sd>Boma Two dives directly at the small target, is unable to 
pull out and crashes into the base of one of the towers.  
Pilot Leader dives between the towers, firing away, but is 
unable to hit the small hole.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT LEADER</speaker>
		It's too small.  It's impossible.
		All ships hit.  Send in Bantha 
		group.  I'll try to make it.</sp>

<sd>One of the two large engines on Pilot Leader's fighter ex-
plodes.  He careens wildly, leaving an erratic trail of 
smoke before eventually crashing into a solar panel.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="129"><setting>  INT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASSONI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM</setting>

<sd>On the large computer display board, several of the markers 
indicating rebel fighters go dark.  General Dodana approaches 
the Starkiller in a hurry.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODONA</speaker>
		Eighty-five percent of our craft 
		have been destroyed.  The proba-
		bility projection shows little hope.
		Retreat is possible at this 
		time, but not for long.</sp>

<sd>Zavos steps forward in a panic.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ZAVOS</speaker>
		It's just like Ogana Major.
		Twice we have listened to 
		this old man, and twice it 
		has led to our ruin.  We 
		must surrender before we're 
		all destroyed, while there 
		is still time.</sp>

<sd>The Starkiller gives Zavos a hard look and the cowardly
General shakes as if a cold wind had chilled him to his
heart.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THE STARKILLER</speaker>
		There will be no surrender.
		There will be no retreat.
		This was settled.  The 
		force is still with us.</sp>

<sd>The General's eyes turn back to the big board as two more 
symbols disappear.  The four that are left are flying in 
formation toward the north pole exhaust port.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DODONA</speaker>
		There are only four left.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="130"><setting>  EXT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - BATTLE</setting>

<sd>Luke swings the small craft around the many outcroppings
of laser towers and transmitters.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		We'll follow you in Banta 
		One.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BANTA ONE</speaker>
		Ship response through here 
		is gone.  Don't try anything 
		fancy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Antilles, Threepio, as soon as 
		you've got the target, open up.</sp>

<sd>The fortress gun emplacements fire away, hitting Banta
Three.  It disintegrates, leaving a trail of flaming parti-
cles.  The three remaining craft continue the assault.
Luke and Antilles watch the remains of Banta Three disap-
pear.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BANTA  ONE</speaker>
		This is it.  Make it count.</sp>

<sd>The rebel craft blast away at the exhaust port, but all
miss.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Sir, I think if you pitched the 
		ship about twelve degrees on the 
		final approach, we could clear 
		the port rim.  It seems to be 
		diagonal, which is why we're off 
		target.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		I think you're right.  Luke, tell

		pass.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<scene n="131"><setting>  EXT. IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS</setting>

<sd>Lord Vader and two other Imperial ships wait for the rebel 
craft to emerge from the smoke and confusion of the exhaust 
port area.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		We'll take what's left when they

</scene>
<scene n="132"><setting>  EXT. BATTLE</setting>

<sd>The three rebel starships bank and prepare for a second
attack on the exhaust port.  Suddenly, streaking down from 
above them, the Imperial TIE craft blaze away with all their 
laser cannons.</sd>

<sd>Banta Four instantly bursts into flames, then disintegrates.  
Banta One's tail section is hit, and the ship pinwheels 
toward the planet.  Blood covers Antilles' face.  Luke 
struggles to keep control of the ship.  Artoo is whistling 
wildly as Threepio swings the gun turret around to fire at 
the enemy craft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Antilles!</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		The turret's shattered.  But 
		both hatches are sealed.  I 
		can hold out.  Just get us back 
		down there.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Well, it looks like we're it.</sp>

<sd>The tiny rebel fighter dives toward the exhaust port, but 
is cut off and forced to turn away from Vader's ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		This is the last one.  Here's 
		where the rebellion ends.</sp>

<sd>The three Imperial craft dive on the lone rebel starfighter.  
Laser bolts streak past the small craft on all sides.  Vader 
moves close in behind Luke's ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
		Where did he go?I can't see him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>
		He's back there somewhere.  Luke, 
		bank a little...See him now?</sp>

<sd>Vader signals his wing men to back off.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
		I've got him.  Return to base.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly, Vader's wing man explodes into a shower of burn-
ing fragments.  Vader is surprised and looks around for the 
cause of his wing man's misfortune.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER (CONT'D)</speaker>
		SR-2, do you see anything?  What 
		did he hit?</sp>

<sd>Before SR-2 can answer, he too is blasted out of orbit.
Vader quickly veers off and takes defensive maneuvers. Above 
and behind the Imperial fighters the old familiar pirate 
starship descends into view.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE (V.O.)</speaker>
		I don't know what brought you

</scene>
<scene n="134"><setting>  EXT. BATTLE</setting>

<sd>Luke dives the tiny ship once again into the wall of laser 
fire around the exhaust port.  The pirate ship follows a 
short distance behind, but begins to bounce about as it 
nears the generating tower.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MONTROSS</speaker>
		There is a terrible magnetic cross-
		field down here.  This thing's too 
		big.  We'll never make it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Hold tight.  We're almost there.</sp>

<sd>Vader's starship swoops down on the battered pirate ship, 
unleashing a heavy barrage of laser bolts.  Chewbacca in 
the rear gun turret blazes away at the Sith starship. One 
of Vader's huge solar fins breaks up, but the Black Knight 
manages to keep the disabled craft on course and crash dives 
into the pirate craft, exploding on impact.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>

</scene>
<scene n="135"><setting>  INT. PIRATE STARSHIP</setting>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<sd>The ship skims the surface of the Death Star, blasting a
thin path across its surface.  As they pass the exhaust
port, both Threepio and Antilles get several shots directly 
down the exhaust shaft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>

<sp><speaker>ANTILLES</speaker>

</scene>
<scene n="137"><setting>  EXT. BATTLE</setting>

<sd>The small craft veers sharply away from the Death Star as 
ominous rumbles and explosions can be heard coming from 
within the huge super fortress.  The rebel ship speeds past 
the small lifepod from the pirate ship as it slowly drifts 
toward the green calm of Yavin's Fourth Moon.  Han, Montross 
and the furry Chewbacca watch the ominous fortress grow 
smaller as they drift further and further away.  Suddenly, 
a great flash replaces the fortress and rubble streaks past 
the lifepod and lone rebel starship.  Several giant explo-
sions follow, until there is only a smoke cloud where the 
mighty fortress once orbited Yavin's Fourth Moon.</sd>

helped down by Threepio.  Antilles gives Luke a big grin.  
Luke slaps Threepio on the back.  He then spots Han, Montross 
and Chewbacca riding up in a transport speeder.  Luke runs 
up and hugs the Corellian pirates.  They all laugh and cheer.</sd>

<sd>The white-robed Starkiller approaches the group, followed by 
a hundred aides, troops, ground crews, and Generals.</sd>

<sd>Antilles and the robots join Han, Luke and the others.  As 
the Starkiller approaches, they all bow low, including 
Chewbacca and the robots.</sd>
