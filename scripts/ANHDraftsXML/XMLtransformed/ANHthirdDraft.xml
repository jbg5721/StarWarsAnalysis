<sd>Journal of the Whills, 3:127</sd>

<sd>"THE STAR WARS"</sd>

<sd>FADE IN:</sd>



<sd>A vast sea of star serves as the backdrop for the MAIN
TITLE, which is followed by a ROLL UP:</sd>

<sd>The REPUBLIC GALACTICA is dead.  Ruthless
trader barons, driven by greed and the 
lust for power, have replaced enlighten-
ment with oppression, and "rule by the
people" with the FIRST GALACTIC EMPIRE.</sd>

<sd>For over a thousand years, generations of
JEDI KNIGHTS were the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.  Now these
legendary warriors are all but extinct.
One by one they have been hunted down and
destroyed by the sinister agents of the
Emperor:  the DARK LORDS OF THE SITH.</sd>

<sd>It is a period of civil wars.  Rebel
Armies, striking from fortresses hidden
deep within the Great rift, have won a
crushing victory over the powerful Imper-
ial Starfleet.  The Emperor knows that
one more such defeat will bring a thou-
sand more solar systems into the rebellion,
and Imperial control of the Outland systems
could be lost forever.  To crush the
rebellion once and for all, the Emperor
has sent one of his most ferocious Dark
Lords to find the secret rebel strongholds
and destroy them...</sd>

<sd>The awesome yellow planet of Utapau emerges from total
eclipse.  A tiny silver spacecraft races into view, fol-
lowed by a giant Imperial stardestroyer.  Hundreds of
deadly laser bolts streak from the Imperial warship as
it dives on the smaller craft.  The overwhelming concen-
tration of laser fire causes the main solar fin of the 
rebel craft to disintegrate, creating a spectacular
heavenly display.  The smoldering rebel ship is quickly
overtaken by the giant Imperial warship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="2"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY2 </setting>

<sd>The chaos of battle echoes through the narrow, main cor-
ridor of the starfighter.</sd>

<sd>An explosion rocks the ship as two construction robots, 
ARTOO DETOO (R2-D2) and SEE THREEPIO (C-3PO) struggle 
to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passage-
way.  Both robots are old and battered.  Artoo is a 
short (36 inches), claw-armed, triped.  His face is a 
mass of computer lights, surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot 
of human proportions.  He has a gleaming bronze-like 
metallic surface of an "Art Deco" design. </sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Did you hear that?  They've shut down 
the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed 
for sure.  This is madness!</sp>

<sd>The little dwarf robot makes a series of electronic sounds
that only another robot could understand.  Rebel troops
rush past the robots, and take up positions in the main
passageway.  Everything is suddenly still and quiet.
Tension mounts as the rebels wait for the pending attack.
Loud metallic footsteps are heard moving around on the
outside the hull of the ship.  The scraping screams of heavy
equipment being dragged across the metal skin of the star-
ship run chills up Threepio's bronze spine.  He huddles in
a small alcove with little Artoo watching the passageway
ceiling.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
There is no escape for the Captain
this time...</sp>

<sd>A tremendous blast opens up a hole six feet wide in the 
side of the main passageway and a score of fearsome storm-
troopers, armed with powerful multi-laser rifles, make 
their way into the smoking corridor.  The rebel warriors
draw their chrome, laser pistols, and blast out several
shots that rip through the Imperial stormtroopers.  </sd>

<sd>In a few moments, the entire passageway blazes with laser
fire.  The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns, 
creating small explosions.  Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
behind storage lockers.  Laser bolts hit several storm-
troopers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding 
shattered arms and faces.  </sd>

<sd>In the confusion, Artoo and Threepio are blown slipping
and sliding into a power canister, but rushing gas from a
broken pipe keeps knocking them over.  The lanky Threepio
becomes entangled in the mass of dangling wires, which
spark and pop every time he attempts to move.  Artoo clings
to a pipe for dear life.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Help me!  I think something is
melting... This is all your fault!
I should have known better than to
trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing-assister...</sp>

<sd>Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as he struggles to
free the larger robot.  The battle rages around the two
hapless robots.  Suddenly, there is a slight lull in the
fighting, then a deathly quiet sweeps over the passageway
as an awesome, seven-foot tall DARK LORD OF THE SITH makes
his way into the blinding light of the main passageway.
This is DARTH VADER, right hand of the Emperor.  His face
is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque
breath mask which stands out next to the fascist white
armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers.  Everyone
instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior.</sd>

<sd>Vader raises his arms and objects that aren't bolted down,
including the rebel warriors, are picked up by an invisi-
ble force and hurled to the end of the passageway.  In
the excitement, Artoo and Threepio have fled down a
sub-hallway.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="3"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY3</setting>

<sd>A death white wasteland stretches from horizon to hori-
zon.  The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settles
on a lone figure, LUKE STARKILLER, a farm-boy with
heroic aspirations; who looks much younger than his
twenty years.  His short hair and baggy tunic give him
the air of a simple-minded, but lovable lout with a
prize-winning smile.  His face is partially covered by
a breath mask and goggles.</sd>

<sd>A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves
on a large chrome pipe, which sticks out of the desert
floor much like and oil-rig christmas tree.  He is aided
by a small, very beat-up tread-robot with six claw arms.
The little robot appears to be barely functioning, and
moves with jerky motions.  A bright sparkle in the morn-
ing sky catches Luke's eye, and he instinctively grabs a
pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Holy maker.</sp>

<sd>He stands transfixed for a few moments, studying the
heavens, then dashes toward his dented, crudely repaired
Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few 
feet above the ground on a magnetic field).</sd>

<sd>He motions to the tiny robot, who is scooting around in
a tight circle, to follow him.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Hurry up!  Come with me.</sp>

<sd>The robot stops short and smoke begins to pour out of 
every joint.  Luke throws up his arms in disgust.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Great, just great!</sp>

<sd>He gives the dwarf robot a swift kick in the side, which
doesn't seem to make much difference.  The young farm boy
rushes to his landspeeder and zooms off leaving the
smoldering robot to hum madly.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="4"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - SUB-HALLWAY4</setting>

<sd>A series of explosions echo throughout the ship as the
tall, gleaming Threepio rushes through the narrow sub-
hallway yelling at Artoo, who is racing along on a small
set of wheels under his center foot.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
They're heading in this direction!
We'll be sent to the spice mines of
KESSEL or smashed into who-knows-
what!</sp>

<sd>Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency life-
pod.  He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red
warning light begins to flash.  The stubby, dwarf-robot
works his way into the cramped four-man pod.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Hey!  You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.  You'll be
deactivated for sure.  Now come out
before someone sees you.  Come on!</sp>

<sd>Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I'm not getting in there.  No more
adventures.  It's too dangerous.  I'm
not that desperate.</sp>

<sd>Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness and he beeps
and twangs angrily.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease...</sp>

<sd>A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and
debris through the narrow sub-hallway.  Flames lick at
Threepio, and after a flurry of electronic swearing from
Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I'm going to regret this.</sp>

<sd>The safety door snaps shut, and with the thunder of ex-
ploding latches, the tiny lifepod ejects from the dis-
abled starfighter.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="5"><setting>INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER - COCKPIT5</setting>

<sd>On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two ter-
rified robots speeds away from the stricken rebel space-
craft.</sd>

<sd>CHIEF PILOT
There goes another one.</sd>

<sp spk="CAPTAIN">
Hold you fire.  No life forms.
It must have short-circuited.  Don't
waste your power...</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="6"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - COCKPIT CORRIDOR6</setting>

<sd>Darth Vader, the black knight, takes a short restraining
pole from one of the guards and brutally jabs a captured
rebel officer in the chest.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
Where is she?  Where is it?</sp>

<sd>The rebel cries out as the spooky looking Sith Lord be-
gins to twist his arm, creating a gruesome snapping and
popping of broken bones.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="7"><setting>EXT. SKY OVER UTAPAU - LIFEPOD7</setting>

<sd>The reddish-yellow mass of Utapau seems to engulf the
tiny lifepod containing the two robots.  The grouping
of starships grows smaller as the pod descends toward
the planet.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
That's funny.  the damage doesn't
look as bad from out here.  Are you
sure this thing is safe?</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="8"><setting>EXT. ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY8</setting>

<sd>A small settlement, consisting of a few rundown block-
house type buildings, rests against one of the huge rock
mesas.  Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached
white buildings.  Luke pilots his landspeeder through
the dusty, empty street of the tiny settlement.  An old
WOMAN runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle,
shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.</sd>

<sp spk="WOMAN">
I've told you kids to slow down!</sp>

<sd>Luke pulls up behind a low concrete service station that
is all but covered by the shifting desert sands.  The
rusted hulk of a landspeeder lies half-buried to one side
of the building.  Luke jumps out of the speeder and runs
into the dilapidated power station.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="9"><setting>INT. POWER STATION - DAY9</setting>

<sd>A dismantled speeder rests in the repair bay of the sta-
tion.  Inside the station's "office" sits THE FIXER,
rugged-looking, about thirty years old, with a big mous-
tache.  On his lap sits CAMIE, a sexy, disheveled girl
about eighteen.  Her cloak is pulled up and one of the
Chief's hands rests on her beautiful thigh.  They are
both sound asleep.  In a small room behind the office
DEAK and WINDY, two tough boys about the same age as
Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with BIGGS,
a tall, handsome startrooper cadet.  His flashy uniform
is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunic of farm
boys.  A robot repairs some equipment in the background.</sd>

<sd>Luke bounces in yelling excitedly, waking The Fixer and
Camie.  The others come in from the other room, and
Camie jumps off The Fixer's lap, pulling her dress down
in a sexy manner.  Luke is surprised at the appearance
of Biggs.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Biggs, you're back!  You graduated
from the academy, you're in the
Starforce.</sp>

<sd>Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.</sd>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
Of course, where you been kid?</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
You look great!  The uniform and
everything!</sp>

<sd>Biggs snaps to attention.</sd>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
Startrooper Biggs Darklighter,
guardian of the Bendu.  At your
service...</sp>

<sd>The dazzling spectacle of his uniformed friend is almost
too much for Luke.  His eyes glaze over.  Suddenly he
snaps out of it.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I almost forgot.  There's a battle
going on!  Right here in our system.
Come and look!</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="10"><setting>EXT. ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY10</setting>

<sd>The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun.
Deak and The Fixer complain, and are forced to shade
their eyes.  Luke has his binoculars out, scanning the
heavens.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
There they are!</sp>

<sd>Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke, as the others
strain to see something with the naked eye.  Through
the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.</sd>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
That's no battle, kid... They're just
sitting there!</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
But there was a lot of firing earlier...</sp>

<sd>Camie grabs the binoculars away from Biggs, banging them
against the building in the process.  Luke reaches for
them.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Hey, easy with those...</sp>

<sp spk="CAMIE">
Don't worry about it, Wormie.</sp>

<sd>Fixer gives Luke a hard look, and the young farm boy
shrugs his shoulders in resignation.</sd>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
You're dreaming, kid.  I don't think
the Empire wants to control this
system.  Believe me, this place is
a big hunk of nothing...</sp>

<sd>Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why.
The group stumbles back into the power station, grumb-
ling about Luke's ineptitude,</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="11"><setting>INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - NARROW SUB-HALLWAY11</setting>

<sd>A beautiful young girl about sixteen years old huddles
in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through
the ship.  She is LEIA ORGANA, a rebel princess.  The
fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted
crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grows
louder.  She steps from her hiding place and blasts two
troopers with her laser pistol, but she is greatly out-
numbered and quickly captured.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="12"><setting>-13INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - HALLWAY - CABIN12-13</setting>

<sd>Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a
squad of armored stormtroopers.  Her hands are bound
with brass bracelets, and she is brutally shoved when
she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching
troops.  They enter a small gloomy chamber where Darth
Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, is sitting.  Vader
speaks in an oddly filtered voice through his complex
breathing mask.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
Did you find anything?</sp>

<sp spk="OFFICER">
Nothing, sir.</sp>

<sp spk="VADER">
It must be on board somewhere.  Destroy
the ship and everything on it.</sp>

<sp spk="OFFICER">
What if they sent a signal?</sp>

<sp spk="VADER">
We would have picked it up... Nothing
got through... It's on the ship.</sp>

<sd>The Officer bows and leaves the chamber.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
I'm a member of the senate.  You can't
hold me... Organa Major is a neutral...</sp>

<sd>Vader raises his arm and as a sudden pain grips Leia,
she doubles up unable to continue.  Vader raises his arm
and a flask on the table mysteriously jumps into his
open hand.  He casually drinks from the flask.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
Enough!  I already know about the
data you've intercepted, but its'
too late.  Whatever information you've
gathered will be destroyed... You will
come to know such suffering as only
the Master of the Bogan Force can
provide...</sp>

<sp spk="LEIA">
You'll get no information from me.
You have no authority... the council
can't hold me!</sp>

<sp spk="VADER">
It appears your ship had an accident.
I will see to it that your death is
duely reported.  There will be no one
to save you this time.</sp>

<sd>His frightening laugh rings throughout the ship.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="14"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA14</setting>

<sd>JUNDLAND, or "No Man's Land," where the rugged desert
mesas meet the foreboding dune sea.  The two helpless
astro-robots kick up clouds of dust as they leave the
lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert
coastline.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
What a forsaken place this is.
We seem to be made to suffer.  It's
our lot in life.  I've got to rest
before I fall apart.  My joints are
almost frozen.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly Artoo makes a sharp right turn and starts off
in the direction of the rocky desert mesas.  Threepio
stops and yells at him.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Where do you think you're going?!?</sp>

<sd>A stream of electronic noises pour forth from the small
robot.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Well, I'm not going that way.  It's
too rocky.  This way is much easier.
What makes you think there are
settlements that way?</sp>

<sd>Artoo counters with a long whistle.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Don't get technical with me.  I've
had just about enough of you.  Go
that way, go on!  You'll be
malfunctioning within a day, you
near-sighted scrap pile!</sp>

<sd>He shoves Artoo and the tiny robot tumbles down a small
dune.  Threepio starts off in the direction of the vast
dune sea as little Artoo struggles to his feet and shakes
a metallic claw at his ex-partner.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
... and don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...
because you won't get it!</sp>

<sd>Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound.  He turns and
trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="15"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - DUNE SEA15</setting>

<sd>Threepio, hot tired, struggles up over the ridge of
a dune, only to find more dunes, which seems to go on
for endless miles.  He looks back in the direction of
the now distant rock mesas.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
You little malfunctioning twerp.
This is all your fault.  You tricked
me into going this way, but you'll do
no better.</sp>

<sd>He sits in a huff of anger and frustration, knocking the
sand from his joints.  His plight seems hopeless, when
a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an
object moving toward him.  The bronze android waves
frantically and yells at the approaching transport.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="16"><setting>INT. POWER STATION - DAY16</setting>

<sd>Luke and Biggs are sitting in a corner of the now empty
power station.  Biggs has had a little too much to drink
and sloppily leans close to Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is
between you and me.  The star force
isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going
to stay that way as long as this
system is neutral...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
But you always said things were so
great at the academy... What happened?</sp>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
The academy is fantastic... Of course,
they won't teach you anything about
flying you don't already know.  Most
of the instructors are very conservative
pilots.  You can fly circles around 
them... but there is a lot on the
scientific side that is down-right
amazing, and you get a lot of
discipline... but after you graduate,
don't join the star force -- go
free-lance.  It's the only way to get
into the action... I can't wait until 
my hitch is up.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
At least you're doing something... I'd
give anything to be in your position.</sp>

<sp spk="BIGGS">
Just be warned, that things aren't
always as they seem... especially the
starforce recruiting posters.</sp>

<sd>They quietly sit in the dim coolness of the station hav-
ing run out of things to say.  Luke finishes his drink
and stands up.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
It's getting late.  I've got to get
back or my uncle's going to kill me.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="17"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON17</setting>

<sd>The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
foreboding mist, and the ominous sounds of unearthly
creatures fill the air.  Artoo moves cautiously through
the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud
clicking noise as he goes.  He hears a distant, hard
metallic sound and stops for a moment.  Convinced he is
alone, he continues on his way.</sd>

<sd>In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon
wall and a small, dark figure darts into the shadows.  A
little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light
reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses, only a few
feet from the narrow path.</sd>

<sd>The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail 
until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray 
shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.  
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples 
over onto his back.  His bright computer lights flicker 
off, then on, then off again.  Out of the rocks scurry 
three MEN, no taller than Artoo.  They holster strange 
and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the 
robot.  They wear grubby cloaks, and their faces are 
shrouded so that only their yellow eyes can be seen.
They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the 
heavy robot to their shoulders and carry him off down the 
trail. </sd>

</scene>
<scene n="18"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET18</setting>

<sd>The eight dwarves, or JAWAS as they're sometimes called,
carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-like vehicle 
the size of a two-story house.  They place the robot under 
a large tube on the side of the vehicle, and the little 
robot is sucked into the giant machine.  </sd>

<sd>The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small lad-
ders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="19"><setting>INT. SAND CRAWLER - HOLD AREA19</setting>

<sd>It is dim inside the hold area of the sand crawler.
Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and
stumbles around the scrap heap.  The narrow beam swings
across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of gro-
tesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots.  He lets out a 
pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what
appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="20"><setting>INT. SAND CRAWLER - PRISON AREA20</setting>

<sd>Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling.  In
the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots
of various shapes and sizes.  Some are engaged in elec-
tronic conversation, while others simply mill about.
A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Artoo Detoo!  It's you!</sp>

<sd>A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces
him.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="21"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON - SAND CRAWLER - SUNSET21</setting>

<sd>The enormous sand crawler lumbers off toward the mag-
nificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a
distant mountain ridge.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="22"><setting>-23INT. ALDERAAN - PRISON CORRIDOR AND CELL22-23</setting>

<sd>Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow
a group of Imperial guards to enter.  Princess Leia's
face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to
fear as Darth Vader enters with a giant black torture
robot.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
Now you will tell me what you did
with the data you gathered. Even
if that information should find its
way to Mouff Tarkin's legions, it
will do them no good.  Your plight
is truly hopeless.</sp>

<sd>Leia stares at the evil lord with determination.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
(continuing)
You will tell me the location of
your hidden bases, and you will tell
me what happened to the data you stole.</sp>

<sd>The door slides shut.  The long cell block hallway
appears peaceful with armored stormtroopers marching
back and forth.  The muffled sounds of the princess'
screaming are barely heard.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="24"><setting>EXT. SAND CRAWLER - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY24</setting>

<sd>A harsh gale blows across the bleak gray surface of the
endless desert wasteland.  The morning sky presses down
on the huge sand crawler as it slowly climbs one of the
massive sand dunes, then disappears down the other side.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="25"><setting>INT. SAND CRAWLER - PRISON AREA25</setting>

<sd>Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the
cramped prison chamber.  Artoo appears to be shut off.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Will this never end?</sp>

<sd>Suddenly the trembling and bouncing of the sand crawler
stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical
men.  Threepio shakes Artoo, and his computer lights
pop on.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Wake up!  Wake up!  We've stopped!!
We're doomed!  This is the end... Do
you think they'll melt us down?</sp>

<sd>At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling
the chamber with blinding white light.  A dozen or so
Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of
robots, placing a small chrome ring to the wrists of the
ones they select.  Artoo and Threepio are among the
chosen, and are herded outside with several other
unfortunates.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="26"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - LAR'S HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON26</setting>

<sd>Five battered robots, including Artoo and Threepio, are
lined up in front of the enormous sand crawler, which
is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three
rundown block houses.</sd>

<sd>The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,
straightening them up, or brushing some dust from a
dented metallic elbow.  The shrouded little creatures
smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark
areas where their mouths and nostrils should be.</sd>

<sd>Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps OWEN
LARS, a large burly man in his mid-fifties.  His reddish
eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face.  As the weather-
beaten farmer carefully inspects each of the robots, he
is closely followed by his slump-shouldered nephew, Luke
Starkiller.  One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead
of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a
queer unintelligible language.</sd>

<sd>Owen picks out a small astro-robot similar to Artoo, and
it waddles along behind the group.  The limping farmer
stops in front of Threepio and studies him carefully.</sd>

<sp spk="OWEN">
Do you speak 'Bocce'?</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Yes, sir, I'm See Threepio, Human-
Cyborg relations.  I have a full T-6
capacity, and...</sp>

<sp spk="OWEN">
That's enough.  Luke, take them to

both of them cleaned up by dinner.</sp>

<sd>As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots
back into the sand crawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic
little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio,
but is restrained by a slimy little Jawa, who zaps him
with a little control box.  Owen is negotiating with the
head Jawa, when Luke notices something on the R-2 unit.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Uncle Owen, this R-2 unit has a bad 
motivator, look!</sp>

<sd>He lifts the R-2 unit's claw arm and it drops lifelessly
to the robot's side.  Owen argues with the Jawas for a
few moments; then with a little reluctance the scruffy
dwarf trades the damaged astro-robot for Artoo Detoo.
Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two
robots trudge off toward a grimy and decaying building
on the far side of the homestead.  Several large rodents
scatter as they pass.</sd>

<sd>The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly, peace-
ful atmosphere permeates the low gray chamber.  In the
center of the room Threepio lowers himself into a large
tub filled with warm oil.  Near the battered "land-
speeder" little Artoo rests on a large battery with a
cord attached to his face.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Thanks the maker!  This is going to
feel sooo good.  I've got such a bad
case of dust contamination, I can
barely move.</sp>

<sd>Artoo beeps a muffled reply.  Luke is slouched in the
corner with his feet up on a bench, watching a magazine
sized TV set.  A woman's voice calls out from the other
room.</sd>

Luke!</sp>

<sd>Luke jumps to his feet, turns off the TV set and starts
dusting little Artoo with an oily rag.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Yes, Aunt Beru... I'm in here.</sp>

steaming bowls of food.  AUNT BERU, a plump, gray-
haired matron, carries in a pitcher of blue milk.  Luke
is in a good mood, and gobbles down his food.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Well, I'm sure glad we finally
bought those extra 'droids.'  I'm
sending my application to the

<sd>Luke's Uncle Owen has a scowl on his face and appears
to be in a very grumpy mood.</sd>

<sp spk="OWEN">

going to check those condensing units
on the south ridge.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I will, but I'll have enough time 
to transmit my application first.</sp>

<sp spk="OWEN">
You'll check the condensing unit
first... and you're not going to bed
until those 'droids' are completely
cleaned up...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
But you promised!  I've saved enough
money and now you have the extra help
... you promised!</sp>

<sp spk="OWEN">
I said we'd see.
(pauses for a
moment)
And as it is, I was forced to borrow 
your academy savings to buy the new
'droids.'  When you've saved it up
again, I'll let you go.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
You used my savings!  You stole my
savings.  If my father were here...</sp>

<sp spk="OWEN">
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget
who's taking care of you, giving you
food, giving you shelter, and giving
you the allowance in the first place.
If you plan to work at the academy the
way you work around here, you won't
last very long.  I don't want another
word.  Finish your dinner, then finish
cleaning those 'droids.'</sp>

<sd>Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and rushes 
out of the room.  Owen mechanically finishes his dinner
afraid to look at his quietly sympathetic wife.</sd>

<sp spk="BERU">
Owen, you know it means so much to
him.  Couldn't you have been a little
easier with him?</sp>

<sd>Threepio timidly approaches the fuming youth.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I beg your pardon, sir, but you appear
to be quite distraught.  Is there
anything I might do to help?</sp>

<sd>Luke glances at the battered robot and a bit of his anger
drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Not unless you could get me into the
military academy at Anchorhead.</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,'
and not very knowledgeable of such
things... not on this system anyway.
As a matter of fact, I'm not even 
sure which system we're on.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
That's all right.  There is nothing

call me Luke.</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio,

my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.</sp>

<sd>Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors
on the robot's head with a chrome pick.  Threepio con-
tinues to dry himself.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
There's a lot of carbon scoring here.
It looks like you boys have seen a
lot of action...</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">

Against the Empire?</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
That's how we came to be in your 
service, if you take my meaning...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Tell me where you've been.  I am
going to become a startrooper and
fight in the wars.  My father was a
Jedi!  Were you in many battles?</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Several, I think.  There is not much 
to tell.  I'm not much more than an
interpreter, and not very good at
telling stories, not at making them
interesting anyway...</sp>

<sd>Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from
Artoo's neck joint.  He uses a larger pick.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Well, my little friend, you've got
something jammed in here real good...

<sd>The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumb-
ling head over heels.  He sits up and sees a small (15
inch) 3-D hologram of Leia Organa, the rebel princess,
being projected from the face of little Artoo.  The image
is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the
dimly lit garage.  Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">

see this R-2 unit delivered safely to

his Aunt Beru is putting the last of the dinner plates
away.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Aunt Beru!</sp>

<sp spk="BERU">

<sd>Luke is out of breath and takes a few moments to compose
himself.  A realization crosses his mind and he suddenly
seems much calmer.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Ahh... I... I'm finished with the

<sp spk="OWEN">

<sd>Owen enters the courtyard in a huff, scattering the large

on "hold."  Beru hurries into the garage.</sd>

<sp spk="BERU">

<sd>As Owen picks up the video-slate, it turns itself on and
Luke's image appears.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Aunt Beru, Uncle Owen, I don't mean
to hurt you and I know you've been
good to me, but I'm leaving.  There
are important things I must do.  I've
taken my speeder and the 'droids' which
you bought with my savings.  I've also
taken my father's lightsaber.  You can
keep everything else.  I am grateful

<sd>The image fades and the old couple stare at one another.

the vast wasteland.  Luke rides precariously on the back
trunk of the vehicle adjusting something in the motor
compartment.</sd>

How's that?</sp>

<sd>Threepio signals that it is fine, and Luke climbs back
into the wind-whipped cockpit and slides the canopy shut.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I've never been this far beyond the
dune sea before.  Biggs said the wild
things out here were weird and savage,
but it doesn't look like there is much

be there soon.  General Kenobi was my
father's commander, and he is probably
the greatest of all the Jedi knights...
or at least my father thought so.  He

<scene n="35"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY35</setting>

<sd>From high on a rock mesa, the tiny landspeeder can be 
seen gliding across the desert floor.  Suddenly in the 
foreground two weather-beaten Tusken Raiders, shrouded in 
their grimy desert cloaks, peer over the edge of the 
rock mesa.  One of the marginally human creatures raises 
a long ominous laser-rifle, and points it at the speeder,
but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be 
fired.</sd>

<sd>The Tusken Raiders speak in a coarse barbaric language 
as they begin to get into an animated argument.</sd>

<sd>The second Tusken seems to get in the final word and 
the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain to where two
large BANTHAS are standing tied to a rock.  The mon-
sterous bear-like creatures are as large as elephants,
with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long
furry dinosaur-like tails.  The raiders mount saddles
strapped to the huge creature's shaggy backs and ride
off down the rugged bluff.</sd>

<sd>The battered landspeeder is parked on the top of a huge
sand dune.  Luke, with his long-barreled laser-rifle
slung over his shoulder, makes his way past the bleached
bones of a dinosaur-like beast.  When he reaches the top
of the ridge, he searches the landscape with his electro-
binoculars.  Threepio lifts Artoo out of the speeder and
the stubby little robot struts around stretching his
joints between irritated whistles.  Luke is depressed as
he returns to the speeder.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
According to my father's tapes, this

up with the landscape... There is no

several massive boulders in the narrow canyon, as Luke
intently studies the pulsing radar scope.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Something is definitely in the next
canyon.  There are two or three of
them, maybe more.
I don't like the looks of it.  It
could be Tusken Raiders or...

try to get a look at them.</sp>

and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars, until
he spots the two riderless Banthas.  Threepio struggles
up behind the young adventurer.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I think we'd better go another way.  
There are two Banthas down there.
I don't see any... wait a minute.
They're Tusken Raiders all right!
I see one of them...</sp>

<sd>Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his elec-
trobinoculars.  Suddenly something huge moves in front 
of his field of view.  Before Luke or Threepio can 
react, a large gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them.
Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side 
of the cliff.  He can be heard for several moments as he 
clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.</sd>

<sd>The towering creature brings down his glowing red laser-
sword, but Luke manages to block the blow with his 
laser-rifle, which is neatly cut in half.  The terrified 
farm boy scrambles backward until he is able to ignite
his own laser-sword and defend himself.  In a flurry of
blows Luke is forced to the edge of a deep crevice.  Luke
stumbles under the mighty blows of the fearsome creature,
drops his sword and almost tumbles over the cliff to his
death.  He hangs on for dear life as his feet dangle 
over the abyss.  The sinister Raider stands over him and
lets out a horrible shrieking laugh that echoes 
throughout the canyon.</sd>

<sd>Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove 
in the rocks as the vicious Tuskens walk past carrying 
armloads of supplies from the battered landspeeder.  As
they disappear, Artoo squirms out of his hiding place
and waddles into the clearing where the speeder is
parked.</sd>

<sd>The vehicle has been ransacked, and Luke is hanging in
a state of bewilderment about ten feet in the air.
Large gold bracelets with small antenna are attached
to his wrists and ankles.  He is spread-eagle and
slowly rotating.  Artoo stands above his master and
beeps a few words of astonishment.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Well, don't just sit there.  Get
something to get me down!</sp>

<sd>Artoo starts searching for something in the speeder that
he might use to get his master down.  He pulls a long
length of wire out of the engine compartment and ties it
into a lasso.  As Luke slowly rotates around, Artoo 
swings the rope and catches the boy around the foot.
The line goes taut but rather than pulling Luke down,
little Artoo is pulled up as if he had roped a windmill.
The stubby robot lets out an electronic shriek and drops
to the ground with a crash.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
We'll have to short circuit these
things somehow...</sp>

<sd>At that moment footsteps are heard coming through the
narrow canyon.  Artoo scampers back into his hiding place.
Luke's face is a roadmap of agony as the footsteps get
louder.</sd>

<sd>A huge menacing shadow on the canyon wall gives way to a
shabby old desert rat of a man, who appears to be at
least seventy years old.  His ancient leathery face, 
cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is set off by 
dark, penetrating eyes, and a scraggly white beard.  BEN
KENOBI squints his eyes as he scrutinizes Luke in his
predicament.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What do you mean, 'good morning'?

mornings in general are good?</sp>

All of them altogether.
You seem to have gotten yourself
into a fine mess!  What happened?</sp>

<sd>The wizened old man begins to giggle like a child,
putting his frail hand to his mouth in a vain attempt
to contain himself.  Luke becomes annoyed.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Tusken Raiders caught me off guard...
Well, kill me or cut me down, but
don't just leave me here, 'cause
I'm about to go out off my mind.</sp>

<sd>Much to Luke's surprise, the old codger draws his laser-
pistol and blasts Luke point blank.  The young farmer
disappears in a cloud of smoke and drops to the ground.
The old man leans over the boy as he rolls over with a
loud groan.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">

get you down.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">

tangled Threepio lies half buried in the gravel.</sd>

then flips a hidden switch on his back several times
until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.</sd>

<sd>Luke is embarrassed and concentrates on making Threepio
comfortable.</sd>

<sd>Luke tosses and turns in his sleep.  Threepio sleeps
peacefully.  Luke keeps hearing the voice of Princess
Leia calling out for help.  Suddenly he sits up with a
start.  He hears Leia's voice coming from the main
living area.  Luke climbs out of bed and quietly makes
his way through the darkened dwelling.  He stops at the
entrance to the main room.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="44"><setting>INT. CAVE SWELLING - MAIN LIVING AREA - NIGHT44</setting>

<sd>Ben is sitting before the flickering hologram image of
Princess Leia.  The old man rests his head in his one
good arm.  His back is to Luke, but he senses the boy's
presence.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
Luke, come here... sit down.</sp>

<sd>Luke walks over and sits across from the old man.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
You were right.  It is my 
responsibility.  The Force of
Others brought the message to you and
then it brought you to me.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
My father used to talk about the
Force of Others.  But he never told
me what it was...</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Let's just say the Force is something
a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an
energy field in oneself, a power that
controls ones acts, yet obeys ones
commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes
marvels appear before your very eyes.
All living things generate this Force
field, even you.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
(amazed)
You mean I generate an energy field?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
It surrounds you and radiates from
you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from
him...
(patting his
stomach)
... from here!</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Could I learn to feel it?</sp>

<sd>The old man leans back and scratches his head smiling
slightly.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
That is not a human decision, not
your or mine.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What do you mean?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
It means you'd better get some rest.
We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley
first thing in the morning.  The
trip will be difficult and dangerous,
but it's the only spaceport with
ships large enough to get us to
Organa Major.  Now go on!</sp>

<sd>Luke reluctantly stands and heads for the bedroom.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="45"><setting>EXT. UTAPAU - ENTRANCE TO CAVE DWELLING - MORNING45</setting>

<sd>Artoo and Threepio carry supplies out of the cave dwell-
ing to where Luke loads them into the landspeeder.  Old
Ben emerges into the sunlight and stretches his new arm.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
It looks like a good day for travel.
The Force is with us.</sp>

<sd>Ben walks over to the speeder and puts his hand on Luke's
shoulder.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
Luke, I'm coming along to do what
I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending
on you to get us through.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
But you're still a powerful Jedi.
You don't need my help.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
A Jedi's power is measured by the 
amount of the Force that is stored 
within him, and I have little of the
Force left in me.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
How can you store an energy field 
within you?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
When a creature dies, the force it
generated remains.  The Force is all
around us.  It can be collected and
transmitted through the use of a
Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to
amplify the power of the Force within
you.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
I had one, but it was taken at the
battle of Condawn...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
That's where my father was killed.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of
my disciple's took the crystal and
became a Sith Lord.  It was a black
day.  The few crystals that remain 
are in the possession of the Sith
Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've
become so powerful.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Do the Sith know the ways of the
Force?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
They use the Bogan Force.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times.
I thought that was just a saying.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
There are two halves of the Force of
Others.  One is positive and will help
you if you learn how to use it.  But
the others half will kill you if you
aren't careful.  This negative side
of the Force is called the Bogan,
which is where the expression came
from, and it is the part that is used 
by the Dark Lords to destroy their
opponents.  Both halves are always
present.  The Force is on your right,
the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber
Crystal can amplify either one.  The
Crystal Darth stole was the last one
in the possession of the Jedi.  When
he joined the Sith, the power of the 
Dark Lords was completed.</sp>

<sd>Artoo and Threepio are already in the speeder, as Luke
and old Ben climb in.  The speeder starts with a low hum.</sd>

<sd>47EXT. UTAPAU - BLUFF OVERLOOKING MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT47
- DAY</sd>

<sd>The speeder zooms across the desert wasteland and
eventually stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport
at MOS EISLEY.  It is a haphazard array of low gray con-
crete structures and semi-domes.  A harsh gale blows
across the stark canyon floor.  Luke adjusts his goggles
and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff, where Ben is
standing.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
Well, there it is, Mos Eisley.  A
more wretched hive of scum and
villainy can't be found this side
of the empire...</sp>

<sd>48EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - SLUM DWELLING - DAY48
 
Luke stops the speeder before the remains of a burnt-
out spaceship the size of a large jet fighter.  Two
scruffy figures huddle around a small thermal heater,
attempting to use the decaying building as shelter
against the howling winds.  One of the rag-tag figures
ventures over to the group in the speeder.  It is
obvious from his pint size that he is a Jawa.  Artoo
lets out a string of electronic beeps and whistles.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I begging your pardon, sir, but watch
out for this thing.</sp>

<sd>The wretched little creature moves close to the speeder
and begins to run his gnarled hand across it.</sd>

<sp spk="JAWA">
Clinga fouf.  Zoom zoom.  Chiq?</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Where are the men who fly in the
ships?</sp>

<sd>Saliva dribbles from the dark hole where the Jawa's face
should be and drops, splat on the hood of the speeder.
Threepio repeats the question in the Jawa's language,
and the vile creature points to the far end of the street
and mumbles something.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
He says there's an inn down the
street.  Lots of fliers there.  But
I wouldn't take his word for it.</sp>

<sd>The Jawa continues to fondle the speeder as Luke starts
the magno-system.  The filthy creature reluctantly jumps
away as the speeder takes off and glides down the dingy
spaceport street.  A giant lizard scurries out of the 
wretched spaceship chased by a stubby Jawa.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="49"><setting>EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - CANTINA - DAY49</setting>

<sd>The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown, blockhouse
cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport.  Various
strange forms of transport, including several unusual
beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I can't abide those Jawas.  Disgusting
creatures.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Take care in here.  I don't like the
looks of this place.</sp>

<sd>Luke, Ben and the two robots climb out of the speeder,
and brace themselves against the constant shipping wind.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="50"><setting>INT. MOS EISLEY CANTINA - DAY50</setting>

<sd>The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants fol-
low Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina.  The
murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of
weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters, laughing
at the long metallic bar.  At first the sight is horrifying.</sd>

<sd>One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly tentacles
and claws huddle over drinks.  Ben and Luke move to an
empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but
human Corellian pirates.  A huge, rough-looking 
BARTENDER comes over to Luke and the robots.</sd>

<sp spk="BARTENDER">
We don't serve 'their kind' in here.</sp>

<sd>Luke, still recovering from the shock of seeing so many
outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the Bartender's
drift.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What?</sp>

<sp spk="BARTENDER">
Your 'droids' will have to wait 
outside.  We don't serve 'em here.</sp>

<sd>Luke looks to Old Ben who is busy talking to one of the
Corellian pirates.  He notices that several of the grue-
some creatures along the bar are giving him a very un-
friendly glare.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Yes, of course.  I'm so sorry.
(turns to Threepio)
You'd better stay with the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.  I'll...
ahh... bring you something.</sp>

<sd>Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of
the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.  Ben
is standing next to CHEWBACCA, an eight foot tall,
savage-looking creature resembling a huge gray bushbaby-
monkey with fierce 'baboon-like' fangs.  His large
yellow eyes dominate a fur-covered face and soften his
otherwise awesome appearance.  Over his matted, furry
body he wears two chrome bandoliers, a flak jacket
painted in a bizarre camouflage pattern, brown cloth
shorts, and little else.  He is a two hundred year old
WOOKIEE, and a sight to behold.  Ben speaks to the
Wookiee in his own language, which is a little more than
a series of grunts.  The old man points to Luke several
times during the conversation and the huge creature
suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh.  Luke is more than
a little bit disconcerted, and pretends not to hear the
conversation between Ben and the Giant Wookiee.  He is
terrified, but tries not to show it.  He quietly sips
his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic
ear or whatever.</sd>

<sd>A large, multiple-eyed CREATURE gives Luke a rough
shove.</sd>

<sp spk="CREATURE">
Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?</sp>

<sd>The hideous freak is obviously drunk.  Luke tries to
ignore the Creature and turns back to his drink.  A
short, grubby HUMAN and an even smaller RODENT-like
beast join the belligerent monstrosity.</sd>

<sp spk="HUMAN">
He doesn't like you.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I'm sorry.</sp>

<sp spk="HUMAN">
I don't like you either.</sp>

<sd>The big Creature is getting agitated and yells some
unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous
young adventurer.</sd>

<sp spk="HUMAN">
Don't insult us.  You just watch
yourself.  We're wanted men.  I
have the death sentence on twelve
systems.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I'll be careful then.</sp>

<sp spk="HUMAN">
You'll be dead.</sp>

<sd>The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the
bar moves away.  Luke tries to remain cool, but it
isn't easy.  His three adversaries ready their weapons.
Old Ben moves in behind Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
This little one isn't worth the 
effort.  Come let me buy you 
something...</sp>

<sd>A powerful blow from the unpleasant Creature sends the
young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing
through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a
foul-looking liquid.  With a blood-curdling shriek, the
monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt
and levels it at Old Ben.  The Bartender panics.</sd>

<sp spk="BARTENDER">
No blasters!  No blasters!</sp>

<sd>With an astounding agility, Old Ben's laser-sword sparks
to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor.  The
rodent is cut in two and the giant, multiple-eyed Creature
lies doubled, cut from chin to groin.  Ben carefully and
precisely turns off his laser-sword and replaces it on
his utility belt.  Luke, shaking and totally amazed at
the old man's abilities, attempts to stand.  The entire
fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.  The cantina
goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable
amount of room at the bar.  Luke, rubbing his bruised
head, approaches the old man with new awe.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
Chewbacca here is first-mate on a
ship that might suit our needs.</sp>

<sd>Luke is still giddy, and downs a fresh drink.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="51"><setting>EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - ALLEYWAY - DUSK51</setting>

<sd>Luke, Ben and the two lumbering robots follow the giant
Wookiee along a narrow slum alleyway crowded with
darkly-clad creatures hawking exotic goods in dingy
little stalls.  Men, monsters and robots crouch in waste-
filled doorways whispering and hiding from the hot winds.
The group enters a small doorway n a decaying stone
building at the far end of the alley.  Several robots
guide a small herd of anteaters down the street.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="52"><setting>INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING AREA 2352</setting>

<sd>Chewbacca leads the group along a tall gantry over-
looking a long Rube Goldburg-pieced together contrap-
tion, which can only be loosely called a spaceship.
Luke gives Old Ben a skeptical look.  Old Ben just
smiles.  As they approach the ship, it looks even more
homemade and shabby than it did at a distance.  The
Wookiee calls out to someone inside the ship, but there
is no reply.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What a piece of junk.  This ship
isn't going to get us anywhere!</sp>

<sd>A tall figure steps out of the shadows of the imposing
spacecraft.</sd>

<sd>This is HAN SOLO, a tough James Dean style starpilot
about twenty-five years old.  A cowboy in a starship
-- simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
This ship has been to Terminus and
back.  There isn't anyplace she
can't go.  She may not look like 
much, but she's special.  I built 
her myself, and there is nothing
faster... What can I do for you?</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca steps forward and explains who the strangers 
are and what they want.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this
vessel.  Who's in charge then?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller
here is leading our expedition.</sp>

<sd>Luke is taken by surprise, thinking that Ben was going
to take care of things.  Han turns to Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Organa Major is a rebel system.
There will be quite a few starfleet
patrols between here and there...
It could be a little tricky if you
want to avoid them... ten thousand.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to
talk it over first.</sp>

<sd>Ben and Luke step to one side.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
We don't have that kind of money.
How much do you think I can get for
the speeder?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.</sp>

<sd>Ben turns back to the young starcaptain.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
Five thousand now and five thousand 
on arrival.</sp>

<sd>Han thinks about this for a second.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave
as soon as you're ready.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
We have a little business to take care 
of first, but it shouldn't take long.
We'll be back shortly.</sp>

<sd>Artoo and Threepio follow Luke and Ben as they hurry
out of the starship hangar.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What if we can't get five thousand?</sp>

<sd>Ben glances back at Threepio.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
We may have to sell one the
droids.</sp>

<sd>A great worry sweeps across Luke's face as he looks back
at the two unaware robots faithfully following after
them.</sd>

<sd>Han Solo grins and slaps the monsterous wookiee across
the back.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Well, old buddy, we're free, and it's
an easy charter at that.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca doesn't share Han's enthusiasm, and makes a
couple of worrisome grunts.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Yeah, yeah, I know we still have a
problem, but maybe we'll be gone by
the time H2 gets back.</sp>

<sd>A commotion filters down from the entry gantry and Chew-
bacca whines pessimistic comment.  A dozen or so gruff
and grisly pirates approach the ship.  The grossest of
the slavering hulks is JABBA THE HUTT.  His scarred face
is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
You're back early.</sp>

<sp spk="JABBA">
A shipment of Covina just took off
for Gordon.  I thought we might
reroute it back here.</sp>

<sd>He laughs maniacally.  Han is not amused.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
You'll have to get yourself another 
boy, Jabba.  I've got a charter.</sp>

<sp spk="JABBA">
Forget it.  We settled this before,
remember?  There's no getting out.
Now get this 'can' started...</sp>

<sd>It's a moment of great tension.  Han glances at the
four pirates standing near them.  Two of the greasy
brigands have their weapons pointed at him.  The young
starcaptain stands firm for a few moments with his hand
resting on his utility belt only inches from his
blaster.  Chewbacca sways back and forth as he adjusts 
his weight from one foot to the other.</sd>

<sp spk="JABBA">
Well??</sp>

<sd>Han turns and reluctantly boards the ship.  Jabba walks
alongside Han and puts his arm around him.</sd>

<sp spk="JABBA">
Han, after all we've been through,
I'm disappointed we're not closer.
You're getting soft now that the
ship's finished.  You may have built 
this bucket, but never forget who 
paid for it, 'cause if you try to
take her out again, I won't be so
understanding.</sp>

<sd>53INT. MOS EISLEY - USED SPEEDER LOT - GARAGE OFFICE -53
NIGHT</sd>

<sd>Ben, Luke and the robots are standing in a sleazy
used-speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-
like used speeder dealer.  Only Threepio can understand
the creature's weird buzzing dialogue.  Strange exotic
bodies and spindly legged beasts pass by outside.  Once
in a while a large lizard or strange animal scurries
across the junk-strewn floor.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
He says it's the best he can do.
Since the XP-21 came out, they just
aren't in demand any more.</sp>

<sd>Luke scratches his head and ponders the situation.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Four thousand isn't going to do it...</sp>

<sd>He looks at Ben, then Artoo, and finally Threepio.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
(to Ben)
I think we're going to need them.
Blast it!</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Sir, I have a couple of extra
circuits.  Perhaps they might bring
something.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need 
five thousand.</sp>

<sd>Threepio buzzes to the salesman, who shakes his head.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Forty-seven hundred, no more.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
He's bluffing.  He'll pay five.  Let's
go.</sp>

<sd>They turn and start out of the rundown showroom.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
This is the last place.  Shouldn't
we just take what we can get and
think of something else?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
He's bluffing...</sp>

<sd>Ben helps Artoo into the speeder as Luke climbs in the
pilot's seat.  The speeder starts up with a loud hum,
but before Luke can back out of the garage area, the
insect stops them.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Five thousand!</sp>

<sd>Luke breaks out in a big smile and Ben manages a slight
grin.</sd>

<sd>As Han and the huge Wookiee work their way past the sin-
ister Jabba the Hutt, the pirate hands the young star-
captain a bulky cloak.</sd>

<sp spk="JABBA">
Take this back with you, boy.</sp>

<sd>Han doesn't mask his hatred for the loathsome pirate 
very well, but takes the cloak and follows the Chew-
bacca toward the back of the ship.  He stops by a small
control panel, knocking it loose with his foot.  The
cover falls to the floor with a muted clang and the
young mechanic looks around to see if anyone heard.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
This is it.  If this doesn't work,
we're diced!</sp>

<sd>He takes a small metal bar and jams it between two cir-
cuits, causing sparks to fly.  He quickly replaces the
cover and Han casually heads back toward the cockpit.</sd>

<sd>He pulls back on the power lever and the ship erupts
into a cacophony of warning alarms and flashing lights.
Smoke begins to issue from the panels.  The pilot is
startled and begins flipping switches wildly.</sd>

<sd>PIRATE PILOT
I think... ahh, I have a problem here

You tell me!  You built it.</sd>

<sd>Han works at the control console in a vain attempt to
figure out what's going on.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">

<sp spk="HAN">

loud wail that startles Luke.</sd>

<sd>Han rushes toward the cockpit as Chewbacca helps Ben
aboard the starship.  The Wookiee shoves Montross out
the hatch just as it slams shut.</sd>

Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.</sp>

<sd>The old man lapses into unconsciousness for several
moments.  Luke doesn't know what to do.  Finally he goes
to Old Ben and lifts his head.  The battered old Jedi
shudders all over, then regains consciousness.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Are you all right?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Yes... the Force... something horrible
has happened.  I couldn't see what it
was, or where it was, but it was
terrible... terrible beyond
description... the cry of millions
dying at once.</sp>

<sd>Luke helps Ben to his bunk.  He's still shaking from
the experience.</sd>

<sd>Princess Leia is awakened by the blinding light of the
hallway as the cell door silently slides open and
Darth Vader enters the cell.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
It is unfortunate you are able to
resist my mind probe.  You are
going through so much needless
suffering.</sp>

<sd>Leia watches her captor impassionately.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
The 'Death Star' has become
operational.  There is no force
in the universe that can stop us now.</sp>

<sp spk="LEIA">
They'll find its weakness.</sp>

<sp spk="VADER">
It's too late... We already tested 
it on Organa Major.  It appears your

<sd>Leia tries not to reveal the shock and pain, but she
is stunned.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
No!...</sp>

<sp spk="VADER">
It would be much easier if you were
to tell us where the outposts are...
Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy
every suspicious system... What a

<sd>Vader starts to leave.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">

<scene n="63"><setting>INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN HOLD AREA63</setting>

<sd>Han enters the cramped but comfortable main hold area
of the starship and begins checking charts and various
computer readouts.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Who's the pilot?</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
It's automatic.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca and the two robots sit around a lighted table
covered with many small hologram figures.  Each side of
the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it.</sd>

<sd>Luke and Old Ben are sitting in the corner, the old
man apparently asleep as Luke cleans a chrome laser-
pistol.  he acts like it's brand new.  he seems very
proud of it.</sd>

<sd>Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his
lanky fur-covered arms over his head.  Artoo immediately
reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw
hand, causing one of the hologram figures to walk to a
new square.  A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and
he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.  Threepio
intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to
argue with the huge Wookiee.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
(to Threepio)
Let him have it.  You're winning
anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I know, sir, but it's the principle
of the thing.</sp>

<sd>Luke sights down the barrel of his new pistol.  Old
Ben opens his eyes.  It's obvious he wasn't asleep.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
(to Ben)
Are you sure you don't need it?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
I rarely use it any more.  I have
the Force.  The Force is more
powerful than any pistol.  You
shouldn't put too much faith in that
weapon.  Work on becoming aware of
the Force... learn to feel its
presence within you.  Try to sense
what it's telling you.  It's the
only thing you can rely on.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What do I do?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
All you have to do is lose your
thinking self.  Don't focus on
anything.  Let your body do your
thinking... You have to learn to act
on what you feel, not what you think
... If I had the crystal, it would
be much easier.  You could feel the
Force immediately... but for now,
let yourself go.  You'll pick it
up... and someday you'll have no
need for that pistol either.</sp>

<sd>Han has been overhearing what Ben has been telling Luke
and obviously has a low opinion of the Force of Others.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'd keep that thing close just in
case, if I were you... I've been
around from one end of the galaxy
to the other and believe me this
Force of Others stuff may make for
good religion, but there is no
substitute for a good weapon at
your side.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
You don't believe in the Force?</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Sorcery!  I believe in myself...
I determine my destiny, not some
mystical energy field.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Well, we'll see...</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
You might get your stuff together.
We'll be coming up on Organa Major
soon.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="64"><setting>INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT64</setting>

<sd>The cockpit is alive with humming meters and softly
buzzing readouts.  Han is busy at the controls as Luke
looks on in wonder.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
It checks out again.  There is no
mistake...</sp>

<sd>Old Ben enters the crowded cockpit.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
What is it?</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
He can't find Organa Major.</sp>

<sd>Han is rather grim-faced.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I found it... It's just not there.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
What are you saying?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Organa Major has been destroyed.</sp>

<sd>Ben moves in and studies the monitors.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
What's left of it is contaminated.
That's it there.  Look at those
radiation readouts!  It's impossible.
I've never seen anything like it.
What's going on?</sp>

<sd>Luke sits back and stares blankly at the monitors.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
The Empire must have gotten here
first.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
The planet has been totally blown
away!  It would have taken a
thousand ships with a lot more fire
power than I've ever seen... If the
Empire had a new weapon that could
do this... I would have heard
something... I'd know about it.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Well, now you know... The enemy is
on the move.  We haven't much time.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Well, I've brought you here.  What
now?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
We have to find he rebels... What
we're carrying belongs to them.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Their bases are very well hidden.
All the power of the Empire can't
find them... Do you know where they
are?</sp>

<sd>Ben shakes his head sadly.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
No, not anymore.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'm not taking you on an impossible
search across the galaxy... I was
only paid to get you here and now
you're here.  I'll take my other 
five thousand and you're on your 
own... I'll leave you on the nearest
system.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
You can't!  We've come this far.  We
must find them...</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Why?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Well, for one reason, we don't have
your other five thousand.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Who's going to pay me then?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
I think there are some things we
should talk about.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'm beginning not to like you.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="65"><setting>INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN HOLD AREA65</setting>

<sd>Little Artoo is standing on the gaming table projecting
the princess into the middle of the group.  Han has a
perplexed look on his face as he ponders the hologram.
Ben leans back in his chair quietly waiting, while Luke
watches the princess with a wistful, smile, far-away look.
Finally the hologram ends.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
How much do you think she's talking
about?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
A million at least... If this robot
has information related to the
destruction of Organa Major, you'll
be able to name the reward...</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Anything I want!  Now that's
interesting.</sp>

<sd>He thinks about this for a few moments.  Luke begins to
get a little edgy.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Maybe you should just drop us off.
I'm sure we can find someone willing
to take the risk.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
All right, all right!
You've got a ship!  But where do
we go from here?  They probably took
her to find the hidden bases... I
don't see how we can find the rebels
before she breaks.  The Empire has
already beat us out.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
She's part of the royal family.
They won't get any information from
her... She knows the art of mind
control... She's a swan sensana.</sp>

<sd>Ben gets lost in his thoughts for a few moments.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
But she is the only link between us
and the hidden bases.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
You mean we should go after her!...</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
I didn't say that, but it appears to
be a logical alternative.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Now wait a minute.  She's in Alderaan!</sp>

<sd>Ben is thinking and doesn't hear Han's protest.  He
turns to Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
No, it's impossible... No one, and I
mean no one would venture anywhere
near the Alderaan system... I'm a
free booter, not revolutionary.  You're
aboard the wrong ship, son!</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Maybe the fact that no one would go
there voluntarily could help us.
They probably don't think anyone
would dare try.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Don't you believe it.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Luke's got a point...
... Fear is their greatest defense...
I doubt if the actual security there
is much greater than on Aquilae or
Sullust, and what there is is most
likely directed toward large-scale
assault.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
This isn't a game, you know.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
How many more systems have to get
blown away before you have no place
to hide and are forced to fight...
Don't you realize what's going on?</sp>

<sd>Han is slightly embarrassed by Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Kid, you take the glory and the good
intentions and I'll take the reward.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Fear is their greatest weapon.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'm not afraid of anything...</sp>

<sd>Everyone looks at Han, and he instantly regrets what
he has said.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="66"><setting>INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - APPROACHING ALDERAAN    66</setting>

<sd>The cockpit is a quiet hum of computers as Han works
diligently on a complex calculation.  Chewbacca enters
the cabin just as the ship begins to shudder violently.
After a few moments the buffeting stops.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
We've just passed into the first
perimeter.  It won't be long now.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca grunts an acknowledgement and points to a
very large and bright star out the front window bay.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
There it is!  Alderaan, the prison 
system.  Take over.
I'm going to go back and see if
they have come up with a plan, or if
we're just going to cruise on in

</scene>
<scene n="67"><setting>INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN HOLD AREA67</setting>

<sd>Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area.  He
seems frozen in place, a humming laser-sword held high
over his head.  Ben watches him from the corner, study-
ing his movements.  Han enters and watches with a bit
of smugness.</sd>

<sd>Suspended at eye level -- about ten feet in front of
Luke -- a chrome baseball covered with antenna hovers
slowly in a wide arc.  The ball floats to one side of
the youth, then to the other.  Suddenly it makes a
lightning swift lunge and stops within a few feet of
Luke's face.  Luke doesn't move, and the ball backs off.
It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick
lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it
attacks.</sd>

<sd>Luke sparks to life.  With one amazingly swift move, he
turns and swings his laser-sword, deflecting the beam.
The seeker shuts off and lands on the floor.</sd>

<sd>Ben is pleased, and Han is quite impressed.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
You have your father's style.  You've
done very well.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Not bad.</sp>

<sd>Luke is sort of embarrassed with all the attention.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Well, I practice a lot...</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
You're good with 'remotes,' but how
are you against something living?</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I don't know... I've never fought
anyone.</sp>

<sd>Han smiles knowingly.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
Enough.  Now try it without thinking.
It's no good talking about the Force.
You must learn to feel it.  Wear this.</sp>

<sd>Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers
his eyes.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I can't see!  How can I fight?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Stop thinking, and start feeling.
Let yourself go.</sp>

<sd>Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the
seeker into the air.  The ball shoots straight up in
the air, then drops like a rock.  Luke swings the laser-
sword around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off
a laser bolt, which hits Luke square on the seat of his
pants.  He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit
the seeker, coming amazingly close, but he is hit
several more times before he manages to finally deflect
one of the bolts.  The ball ceases firing and moves back
to its original position.  Luke removes the helmet and
is a sweaty, exhausted mess.</sd>

<sp spk="BEN">
See, once you let yourself go you
can do it.  You'll get it.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I don't get it, but I guess I did
block it.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'd call it a lucky move.</sp>

<sd>Han in a split second draws his laser-pistol and blasts
the seeker.  The ship begins to shudder, then a distant
warning signal goes off.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
We're into the second perimeter.
They'll be coming out to blast us
shortly.  I was wondering if you
had some kind of a plan or are we
going to try to blast our way in?</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
Check your data banks for all the
information you have on Imperial
procedures.  Both of you will have
to learn...</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
We're going to get in by studying
Imperial procedures?  I don't like
it.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
All right then, we'll use your plan.</sp>

<sd>Han slumps in his seat with a dejected look.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I'll get the information.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
... and I want you to start cleaning
the equipment out of the scan-
shielded compartments.</sp>

out like menacing tentacles.  The peacefulness of this
nebulous idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion
engines.  Suddenly four sleek spacefighters from the

about to enter the cockpit area, they hear a loud 
clanking movement.  The ferocious stormtroopers freeze
and simultaneously direct their awesome weapons at the

their way toward the cockpit.  The tension becomes

ward.  With a bone-chilling howl, the giant Wookiee
flattens the Officer with one blow.  The aide imme-
diately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by
Han, which sets off a series of small explosions on
the control panel.  Han and Luke enter the room dressed
as Imperial stormtroopers.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight, the entire city
is going to know we're here.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to
all this sneaking around.</sp>

<sd>Ben feeds some information into the computer, and a
map of the city appears on the monitor.  He begins to
inspect it carefully.  Threepio and Artoo look over
the control panel.  Artoo finds something that makes
him whistle wildly.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
We've found it, sir.  Bless the
maker, this control board has one.</sp>

<sd>Han and Luke rush over to the robots.  Chewbacca busies
himself with hanging the Gantry Officer by his toes.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Plug him in.  Let's see what we get.</sp>

<sd>Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and
the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding
information to the little robot.  After a few moments
he beeps something to Threepio.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Level five, Detention block A-23,
cell 2187.  She's still alive...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Send feed-back into the control
sensors in that Detention block.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
That's straight through the central
core... up toward the top of the 
city... Once you've got her, avoid
the main transports, they'll shut
down immediately.  Your only chance 
is through the service shafts.
There are no sensors there... All
right now, get going, you don't 
have time.  I hope you can remember
everything.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
We'll be back before you are, old
man.</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
May the Force be with you.</sp>

<sd>Old Ben slips out of the control bay and disappears
down a long gray hallway.  Han whistles for Chewbacca
to join them.  Luke binds the huge Wookiee with elec-
tronic cuffs.  The Wookiee has a worried and slightly
frightened look on his face.  Han reassures him and
straightens his jacket.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Luke, sir!  pardon me for asking
... but, ah... what are we to do if
someone should discover us here?</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Hope they don't have blasters.</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
That isn't very reassuring.</sp>

<sd>Luke and Han put on their armored helmets and start off
into the giant Imperial city of Alderaan.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="84"><setting>-85INT. ALDERAAN - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE84-85</setting>

<sd>Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored
suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.
Troops, bureaucrats and robots bustle about ignoring
the trio completely.  Only a few give the giant Wookiee
a curious glance.  Finally a small elevator arrives
and the trio enter.  A bureaucrat races to get aboard
also, but is signaled away by Han.  The door to the
pod-like vehicle slides closed and it takes off
through a vacuum tube.  Han rubs his hand across a
series of small holes.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Gas... Old Ben was definitely right.
If they discover us, we'll never get
out this way.</sp>

<sd>He gives Luke a skeptical look.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="86"><setting>-87INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY AND SUB-HALLWAY86-87</setting>

<sd>Old Ben walks very quietly behind two Imperial officers
who don't seem to be aware of his presence.  They pass
several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio
but no one appears to notice Ben.  The old man deftly
slips down a sub-hallway and hides in a shallow alcove
as a patrol of twenty guards passes.  He rushes down an
ever smaller hallway and disappears.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="88"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - DETENTION AREA - DUNGEON88</setting>

<sd>The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old,
gray security station.  Guards and laser gates are
everywhere.  Han whispers to Luke under his breath.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
This isn't going to work.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Why didn't you say so before.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
I think I did.</sp>

<sd>A tall, grim-looking OFFICER approaches the trio.</sd>

<sp spk="OFFICER">
What code is this?</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I've got it here somewhere... It's
SPT 188544.  You can check it through
the... ahh, oh yes, lex-321.</sp>

<sp spk="OFFICER">
It will take a while -- the cross
mode is acting up... getting feedback
from somewhere.</sp>

<sd>The Officer goes back to his console and begins to punch
in the information.  There are only three other troopers
in the area.  Luke and Han survey the situation, checking
all of the alarms, laser gates and camera eyes.  Han
unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs
to Luke.</sd>

<sd>Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with
one of his ear-piercing howls.  He grabs Han's laser-
sword and ignites it, pushing Han against the wall.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Look out!  He's loose!</sp>

<sd>The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded.  Luke
and Han have already pulled out their laser-pistols
and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee.  Their
barrage of laser fire misses Chewbacca, but hits the
camera eyes, laser gate controls and the Imperial guards.
The Officer is the last of the guards to fall under the
laser fire, just as he is about to push the alarm
system.  Luke rushes over to the com-link system, which
is screeching questions about what is going on.  Han and
Chewbacca disappear down one of the sub-hallways.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but
we've subdued him... There is a lot

<sd>Luke cuts off the com-link and yells down the cell row
to Han.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Hurry up.  I think we're going to
have company.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="89"><setting>-90INT. ALDERAAN - PRISON CORRIDOR - CELL89-90</setting>

<sd>Han stops before cell 2187 and yells something to Chew-
bacca, who covers his face as the young pirate blasts
the door away  with his laser pistol.  When the smoke
clears, Han looks in the cell and an expression of
horror crosses his face.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
'Holy Maker,' NO!</sp>

<sd>Suspended inside the cell by invisible rays, a bloody
and mutilated Leia Organa hangs upside down.  A strange
yellow glow radiates from her eyes.  Chewbacca rushes 
into the cell past the dazed Han.  The Wookiee yells
something and Han comes to, firing his pistol at a
small control box in the wall.  The unconscious princess
drops like a rock into the giant Wookiee's arms.  Chew-
bacca slings her over his shoulder and joins Han in the
hallway.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Luke, we've got her, let's go...</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="91"><setting>-92INT. ALDERAAN - DETENTION AREA - DUNGEON - HALLWAY91-92</setting>

<sd>A series of explosions knock a hole in the wall through
which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.  Luke
fires his laser pistol at them through the smoke and
flames.  He turns and runs down the cell hallway.  He
takes a small com-link transmitter from his belt.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="94"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER94</setting>

<sd>Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps

small com-link transmitter.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
I said, all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.  I respectfully
suggest you return at once...</sp>

<sd>The transmitter squawks a short reply and Threepio peeks
out the tower window at the starship.  All is quiet.  He
then moves to the door and it slides open a crack.
Several troops rush past, yelling and shouting order.
Threepio slams the door shut and pushes the lock lever.
Someone begins banging on the door.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Oh, no!</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="95"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO CRYSTAL CHAMBER95</setting>

<sd>Ben starts into the hallway leading to the crystal cham-

ducks into the nearest doorway which opens and swallows
him up.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="96"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - CLASSROOM96</setting>

<sd>Ben finds himself in a small conference room filled
with about a dozen or so bureaucrats listening to an
instructor who is explaining a type of technical
philosophy.  The class turns and stares at the old man.
Ben raises his hands and all the bureaucrats, including
the instructor, begin coughing and grabbing at their
throats.  They are unable to breather and eventually
collapse on the floor.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="97"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO THE CRYSTAL CHAMBER   97</setting>

<sd>One of the Sith Lords stops in the hallway opposite the
classroom door.</sd>

<sd>1ST LORD
What is it?</sd>

<sd>2ND LORD
Do you feel that?</sd>

<sd>1ST LORD
I don't feel anything.</sd>

<sd>2ND LORD
Maybe you're too young.  It's the 
Force... If I didn't know better I'd
say we were in the presence of a Jedi
knight.</sd>

<sd>The first Sith Lord puts his hand to his ear as a message
comes through on his helmet intercom.</sd>

<sd>1ST LORD
They're calling for us again on the

<sd>The two Dark Lords hurry off down the hallway and Old
Ben silently exits the classroom.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="98"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - DUNGEON - PASSAGEWAY98</setting>

<sd>Luke leads Han and the Wookiee down the ever-darkening,
narrow passageway.  Han and Luke switch on small lights
in their gunbelts.  The rhythmic marching of storm-
troopers seem to be getting louder.  Muffled voices can
be heard.  Luke stops before an intersecting hallway.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
They're right behind us.  Which way?</sp>

<sd>Luke grabs his belt com-link and attempts to contact
Threepio.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">

<sd>Static and no reply.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">

<sd>As they descend into the bowels of the city, the eerie,
slimy corridor becomes narrower and filled ankle-deep
with water and ooze.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="99"><setting>INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER99</setting>

<sd>A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out
for See Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand com-
link which is sitting on the deserted computer console.
Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight.  Suddenly there
is a great explosion and the door to the control tower
flies across the floor.  Four armed stormtroopers enter
the chamber.  A muffled voice can be heard coming from
one of the supply cabinets.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Help!  Help!  Let us out.</sp>

<sd>The troops inspect the dead bodies and release Threepio
from the supply cabinets.  Artoo is shut down and does
not move.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
They're madman!  They are heading
for the prison level.  If you hurry,
you might catch them... they just
left.</sp>

<sd>The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving two
guards to watch over the control room.</sd>

<sd>Threepio takes a round disk-like object and attaches it
to Artoo's head, which lifts him a foot off the ground
and moves him toward the door.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
All this excitement has burned out
my counterpart.  If you don't mind,
I have to take him down to maintenance.</sp>

<sd>The guard nods and Threepio with little Artoo in tow
hurries out the door.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="100"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY100</setting>

<sd>Artoo sparks to life and the two robots scurry off down

</scene>
<scene n="101"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - CRYSTAL CHAMBER101</setting>

<sd>Old Ben carefully approaches the pedestal on which the
Kiber Crystal is resting.  He gracefully sidesteps a
series of invisible beams.  It looks as if he is doing
a strange dance.  Ben stops about five feet in front of
the Crystal.  His eyes light up, and it appears he is
renewed with a new inner strength.</sd>

<sd>Ben lifts his arms and slowly the Crystal begins to
rise off the pedestal and move toward the old Jedi.
The intense glow of the magical stone increases as it
passes through an invisible protective death ray.
Just before it reaches Ben's hand, it passes through
a blue beam that sets off an alarm which instantan-
eously slams the door shut and the room glows a bright 
red.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="102"><setting>-103   INT. ALDERAAN - DUNGEON - PASSAGEWAY102-103</setting>

<sd>The passageway has gotten so small that Han, Luke and
Chewbacca must walk sideways.  The princess is standing
between Luke and the Wookiee and is semi-conscious.</sd>

<scene n="102"><setting>-103   CONTINUED:102-103</setting>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I think she's going to be all right.</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Not if this tunnel deadends.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly the way opens up to a wide, low-ceilinged
corridor that is filled with water about waist high.
At the far end of the tunnel is a small light.  Chew-
bacca puts the princess back over his shoulder.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I see a light.  We may get out of 
this yet.</sp>

<sd>The princess wakes up and is thoroughly confused by
her surroundings.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
What is it?  What's going on?  Where
are we?</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
You're safe.  We've come to get you
out of here... Just relax.</sp>

<sd>The two boys wade into the submerged corridor, but Chew-
bacca won't enter.  He frantically begins sniffing the
air and jabbers something to Han.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
There is no choice.  The troops are
right behind us.  Come on.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca won't budge.  He seems terribly afraid of
something in the water.  Han wades back and pulls the
huge Wookiee carrying the princess into the water.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Is he afraid of the water?</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
No, he smells something... but we
haven't time to worry about it now.</sp>

<sd>The group moves forward through the dark corridor,
unaware of the ominous ripples on the water's surface.</sd>

<sd>The giant Wookiee stops and howls something to Han.  The
young starcaptain talks to the frightened creature and
eventually calms him down.  The dim light at the end of
the corridor glimmers and becomes stronger.</sd>

<sd>A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from
the murky depths followed by a huge jellyfish-like form,
which shoots out of the water and towers above the pet-
rified group.  Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and
begins to back away.  Han and Luke stand fast with their
laser-pistols drawn.  The Wookiee is cowering near one
of the walls with the groggy princess on his shoulder.</sd>

<sd>Han fires directly at the center of the beast.  His laser
bolt passes through the huge creature and explodes against
a far wall.  The light from the blast reveals a little
more of the Dia Nogu, which is transparent with long
slimy tentacles.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
It's not a natural creature... our
weapons are no good against it.</sp>

<sd>The huge shape, breathing loud and deep, submerges again
and the telltale ripples head toward Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Watch it!  Move back.</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it.
I'll draw it away.</sp>

<sd>Han turns and wades back to Chewbacca, who is huddled
against the wall.  The Wookiee is shaking and wailing
like a small child.  In the thin light provided by the
small door at the end of the passageway, the faint out-
line of the Dia Nogu can be seen as it swims by Luke.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
It just passed me.  Maybe it's
harmless.  I'm gong to try for that
opening.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly Luke is yanked underwater.  Han has blindfolded
Chewbacca and is attempting to lead the Wookiee and the
princess toward the lighted opening at the far end of
the tunnel.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Luke!  Where are you?  What happened?</sp>

<sd>Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs
with a membrane tentacle wrapped around his throat.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Get gong!  I'll keep it busy.</sp>

<sd>Luke is dragged under again.  Han grabs the princess and
makes his way around the treacherous creature to the
small opening at the end of the passageway.  Luke bobs
to the surface with a severed tentacle dangling around
his neck.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
It's only light that doesn't affect
it.  Solid things, like rocks, can
hurt it!  Fire above him!</sp>

<sp spk="HAN">
Move out of the way!</sp>

<sd>Luke tries to swim away, but is grabbed by the creature.
Han fires his laser-pistol into the ceiling above the
creature, knocking rocks and debris on top of it.  The
Dia Nogu thrashes about for a few moments, then the water's
calm, and all is quiet.  There is no sign of Luke.  Han
bows his head as the hope drains from his face.  Chewbacca
lifts the princess through the small opening in the wall,
then struggles to squeeze himself through also.  Han
starts to turn back toward the escape hole, when Luke
pops out of the water with a gasp and starts swimming
like mad toward the starcaptain.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
It's still alive.  It's gone crazy.
Get out of here!</sp>

<sd>The boys rush up to the small escape port only to find
Chewbacca stuck.  Luke begins pushing the Wookiee as Han
turns and fires off another blast at the ceiling.  A rush
of rock and debris temporarily holds off the charging
Dia Nogu.  Han helps Luke push Chewbacca through the hole.
Then the two boys scamper to safety just before the fear-
some creature begins another charge.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="104"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - UNUSED HALLWAY104</setting>

<sd>The group is standing in a dusty unused hallway.  The
Dia Nogu bangs against the opening and a long slimy
tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for
a victim.  Han aims his pistol.  The princess is groggy,
but conscious.  She takes command of the situation.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
No, wait!!  They'll hear...</sp>

<sd>Han fires at the doorway, creating an avalanche of
rubble which buries the monster.</sd>

<sd>The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout
the empty passageway.  Luke simply shakes his head in
disgust.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
Listen, blockhead, I don't know
where you came from, and I'm
grateful, but from now on you do
as I tell you.</sp>

<sd>Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
Luke bows before the princess.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.</sp>

<sp spk="LEIA">
There'll be time for that later.
Now let's get out of here.</sp>

<sd>The group moves swiftly down the deserted corridor.  The
awkward silence is broken by Han, who's about had it with 
the princess.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I don't care if the entire city heard
me.  All this sneaking around is going

<sd>Troops carry the two unconscious guards from the pirate
starship and march past Threepio and little Artoo, who
are hidden near a tiny service panel.  Artoo removes
the panel and sticks his claw arm into the socket.  The
little robot's circuits immediately light up and one of
his antenna begins to spin wildly.  Smoke begins to pour
from him before Threepio can pull him loose.  Artoo lets
out with a few wilted beeps as he cools off.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Well, next time pay more attention.
You could have been fried... Are

Jedi, standing with his laser-sword drawn.  For a brief
moment the Commander and his men are stunned.</sd>

<sp spk="COMMANDER">

<sd>Before the troops can fire their weapons Old Ben has

<sd>The two boys rush down the hallway, followed by the lum-
bering Chewbacca and Princess Leia.  They round a corner
and run smack dab into twenty Imperial stormtroopers
heading towards them.  Both groups are taken by surprise
and stop in their tracks.  Before even thinking, Han
draws his laser-pistol and charges the troops, yelling
at the top of his lungs.  The troops are startled by
this assault and start to back off.  Han manages to cut
several down before the rest flee in panic.  Pleased
with his prowess, Han starts after them, yelling back to
Luke as he goes.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Get to the ship!</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">

<sd>Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.  Chew-

a mighty howl and chases after him.</sd>

<scene n="113"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY - BLAST SHIELD DOOR113</setting>

<sd>Luke and the princess run down a hallway and reach a
complex blast shield door.  Luke is talking into his
com-link.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Are you hooked into the system?...
Good.  Open the shield door... 11054B...
hurry...</sp>

<sd>Han and Chewbacca come lumbering around the corner and
rush up to Luke and the princess.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Can you get it open?</sp>

<sd>A multi-layered series of doors begin to open behind
them, just as the squad of stormtroopers that are
chasing Han and Chewbacca round the corner and start
firing on the rebels.  Han returns the fire and the
hallway quickly fills up with smoke and confusion
as the final hatch swings open.</sd>

<sd>They turn and start into the main spaceport causeway.
A few steps into the causeway the group stops short.
Two Dark Lords of the Sith, leading about thirty storm-
troopers, stride toward them.  Luke and Han let loose
with their blasters, then follow the princess and the
Wookiee back into the first hallway.  Luke takes out
his com-link.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
See Threepio... Close the shield door!
Close the shield door quickly... lock
it tight!</sp>

<sd>The five layers of the door instantly slam shut.  Laser bolts
continued to ricochet around them.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Now what!?!</sp>

<sd>Luke shrugs his shoulders.  The stormtroopers continue
their assault, filling the hallway with smoke and debris.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
This way, hurry!</sp>

<sd>She rushes over to a large slit in the wall somewhat
like a storm drain.  She jumps through the narrow open-
ing as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement.  Chew-
bacca says something.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
Go on!  You big furry oaf.</sp>

<sd>He shoves the Wookiee into the tiny opening and the
Wookiee disappears into the darkness followed quickly
by Han.  Luke fires off a couple of quick blasts,
creating a smoky cover, then slides into the garbage
chute and is gone.  When the smoke clears, the troops
advance.</sd>

<sp spk="SERGEANT">

</scene>
<scene n="114"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - SPACEPORT - GARBAGE ROOM114</setting>

<sd>Luke tumbles into a large room filled with garbage and
muck.  Han and Chewbacca are already stumbling around
looking for an exit.  He finds a small hatchway and
struggles to get it open.  It won't budge.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
(sarcastic)
The garbage chute wasn't a bad idea,
your highness, but unfortunately these
trash rooms are vacuum sealed.</sp>

<sd>He draws his laser-pistol and fires at the hatch.  The
laser bolt ricochets wildly around the small metal
room.  Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the
bolt explodes almost on top of them.  Leia climbs out
of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.</sd>

<sd>LEIA 
Put that thing away or you're going
to get us all killed.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
(sarcastic)
Yes, your highness.
I'll let you open it then.  It won't
be too long before they figure out
what happened to us.  This has
turned into a brilliant escape!</sp>

<sp spk="LEIA">
It could be worse...</sp>

<sd>Luke and the princess go over to help Chewbacca, who is
straining to open the emergency latch.  Han moves about
in the muck.  Suddenly the walls of the garbage recep-
tacle shudder and move in a couple of inches.  Then
everything is deathly quiet.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I've got a very bad feeling about 
all this.</sp>

<sd>Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble
and edge toward the rebels.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
Don't just stand there.  Try to brace
it with something.</sp>

<sd>They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
trash masher rumbles on.  The situation doesn't look
good.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
This isn't working, your highness.</sp>

<sd>The room gets smaller and smaller until it is only three
feet wide.  Garbage is snapping and popping as it is
crushed by the relentless walls.  Luke's com-link begins 
to buzz, and he pulls it off his belt.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...</sp>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Are you there, sir?  We're going...</sp>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage
mashers on your level... Do you copy??
Threepio, shut down all garbage...</sp>

<sd>The rumbling walls continue.  It looks hopeless, and
then they stop.  Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.
Luke goes over to the pressure hatch and scrapes some
muck off a number.</sd>

<scene n="116"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY116</setting>

<sd>Old Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the
starship hangar.  Just before he is about to reach the
hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the
tunnel not more than ten feet away.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
I've been waiting... At least we meet
again... It could only have been you...</sp>

<sp spk="BEN">
The Force of the Bogan has grown
strong with you.  I expected your
master...</sp>

<sp spk="VADER">
You were once my master, but I am the
master now... the Crystal will be of
little use to you...</sp>

<sd>The fearsome dark knight ignites his laser-sword and takes
a defensive stance.  The two galactic warriors stand per-
fectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and
waiting for the right moment.  Old Ben seems to be under
increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight
were being placed upon him.  He shakes his head and,
blinking, tries to clear his eyes.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
Your powers are weak... Old man, you
should never have come back.</sp>

<sd>Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is
checked by a lightning movement of the Sith.  A master-
ful slash-stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi.
Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered.
Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into
the massive starship hangar.  The two powerful warriors
stand motionless for a few moments with laser-swords
locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="117"><setting>INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY - STARSHIP117</setting>

<sd>Threepio looks up and sees Ben emerging from the hallway.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
There's the general!  Where are the
others?... Oh, no!</sp>

<sd>Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers
who were guarding the starship rush past them heading
toward Ben and the Sith knight.  When the robot ven-
tures another peek, he spots Han, Luke, Chewbacca and
the princess running out of a tunnel on the other side
of the starship and heading toward them.  He pulls on
Artoo.</sd>

<sp spk="THREEPIO">
Unplug yourself.  We're going!</sp>

<sd>Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes
that he is trapped.  Vader takes advantage of Ben's
momentary distraction and brings his mighty laser-sword
down on the old man.  But Ben manages to deflect the
blow, swiftly turning around, cutting a safety lock on
the blast door.  Vader is standing in the access tunnel,
while Ben is in the huge hangar, and the heavy blast
door slams down between them, trapping Vader in the
tunnel.</sd>

<sd>Ben instantly turns toward the troops.  They stop in
their tracks and start to raise their weapons.  Before
they can fire a shot, a laser bolt explodes in the
middle of them, creating havoc.  The troops turn around
to see Luke and Han firing on them from the ramp of the
starship.  Threepio and Artoo run up the ramp and dis-
appear inside the ship.  Chewbacca appears at the door
of the pirate ship and throws a dead stormtrooper onto
the hangar floor.  Luke turns to Han.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Get the ship started!</sp>

<sd>As Han starts up the ramp, Leia grabs the laser-pistol
out of his hand.  Han starts to grab it back, then
thinks better of it and rushes into the starship.  Ben
charges into the troops, cutting them down as he goes.
Luke is forced to stop firing and runs to the old man's
aid with his laser-sword drawn.  Several of the troops
flee in panic, but the two that remain fire their laser-
pistols point blank at the old man.  Ben deflects the
bolt, but it explodes near him and he slumps to the
floor in a heap.  Luke cuts down the remaining troops
and rushes to the old Jedi's side.</sd>

<sd>Ben is still alive, but badly hurt.  A fresh squad of
stormtroopers appear at a second tunnel, and Leia fires
off a blast that makes them duck for cover.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
Luke, quickly!  There are more coming!</sp>

<sd>Luke struggles to drag the old man toward the ship under
the constant fire of the Imperial troops.  Luke fires
back whenever possible and manages to keep the troops at
bay.  The princess takes careful aim and hits the safety
lock on the blast door, causing it to slam shut, leaving
only three troops left in the hangar.  The princess runs
down the ramp and helps Luke drag the old man aboard.
Luke puts away his laser-pistol and takes out his com-link.</sd>

<sd>The blast doors quickly slide open revealing Darth
Vader, an Imperial commander and many troops.  The Dark
Lord casually enters the hangar bay and speaks to the
commander.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">

<sd>Chewbacca squeezes into the pilot's chair next to the

<sd>Han jumps into the turret opposite Luke and begins to
strap himself in.  The pirate starship shudders as the
Imperial fighters open fire.  Luke's turret swings
around as he continues to return the fire.  Moments 
later Han lowers his glare reflector and with a burst 
of smoke and electrical charge opens up on the enemy
craft.  One of the Imperial fighters is hit by a con-
centrated barrage and begins spinning out of control,

wave, which Luke gleefully returns.</sd>

<sd>A large, sallow-eyed general named AAY ZAVOS fiddles
nervously with a small hand computer.</sd>

<sp spk="ZAVOS">
The greatest concentration of fire

force and use delayed link-weapons.</sp>

<sd>The GRAND MOUFF TARKIN, the thin commander of the out-
land Kesselian Dagoons, stands.</sd>

<sp spk="TARKIN">
An assault force is too big.  Their
lateral defenses are too strong for

respect, I suggest an attack with
our smallest, most maneuverable
ships.  If we can get close enough,
I think we can target it.</sp>

past the guards and approached the princess.</sd>

attack on that Death Star?
Part of my reward is that I be

<sd>RED LEADER
Take a special note of these

concentration of fire power on the

towers will probably create a strong
magnetic field.  It is calculated

<sp spk="TARKIN">
We must have a direct hit.  Yellow

for blue on the second.  Any questions?</sp>

<sd>A muted buzz moves throughout the room, but there are
no questions.</sd>

<scene n="136"><setting>INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK136</setting>

<sd>Luke and little Artoo enter a huge spaceship hangar
carved out of the interior of the crumbling temple and
hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.</sd>

<sd>Flight crews rush here and there loading last minute
armament and unlocking power couplings.  Luke is
stopped by Blue Leader, a rugged, handsome man in his
forties.  He has the confident smile of a born leader.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
You're Starkiller?</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Yes, sir.</sp>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Have you been checked out?</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of
the best bush pilots on Sullust.
I've also had six hours on the T-2.</sp>

<sd>Blue Leader has a skeptical look on his face.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your
ship there.  You're blue five.  You
stay glued to me.  I don't want any
independent operations out there.
Personally I think it's foolish for
them to be sending fresh kids out
on a job like this.  This is no joy
ride we're going on.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Yes, sir.</sp>

<sd>A warning buzzer sounds and Blue Leader smiles.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
May the Force be with you.</sd>

<sd>Luke makes a short bow from the waist as Blue Leader
hurries to his ship.  Luke's ground crew has hoisted
little Artoo into a socket on the back of the one-man
starship fighter.  Luke climbs aboard the sleek, deadly
spacecraft.  Blue Leader gives his ground crew the sig-
nal that he is starting his ion engines.  Luke's CREW CHIEF
pats him on the helmet and has to yell to be heard over
the ion engines.</sd>

<sp spk="CHIEF">
That R-2 unit of yours seems a little
beat-up.  Do you want a new one?</sp>

<sd>Luke shakes his head no.</sd>

<sp spk="CHIEF">
Knock them all the way back to
Alderaan.</sp>

<sd>The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves
into a deep runway shaft that leads to the outside.  Luke
checks out the computer readouts as his crew locks down
the armament.</sd>

<sp spk="LUKE">
Artoo, are you secure?</sp>

<sd>The little droid, who is now part of the exterior shell
of the starship, beeps that he is fine, which reads out
over the computer monitor.  One of the crewman climbs
up to the cockpit.</sd>

<sp spk="CREWMAN">
I've removed the lateral casings,
which should make you about a
thousand pounds lighter.</sp>

<sd>He hangs a small good luck charm inside the cockpit as
the canopy starts to slide closed.  Luke signals to the
crewmen that everything is okay.  Other crewmen say
goodbye to their pilots, some serious, some kidding --
all with a great deal of hidden emotion.</sd>

<scene n="137"><setting>EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE137</setting>

<sd>All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard
standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the
dense jungle.  The muted, gruesome crying sounds that
naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed
by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver
starships catapult from the foliage in a tight forma-
tion and disappear into the morning cloud cover.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="138"><setting>INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM138</setting>

<sd>The princess sits quietly before the giant display show-
ing the planet of Yavin and her four moons.  The red dot
that represents the Death Star moves ever closer to the
system.  A series of green dots appear around the fourth 
moon.  The Grand Mouff Tarkin stands behind the princess
with several other field commanders.</sd>

<sp spk="TARKIN">
They're all away.  For the first
time since the take-over, I feel
real hope.</sp>

<sd>Everyone turns as Threepio enters with Old Ben who is 
walking with a chrome cane.  The old man smiles at the
young princess.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">
Switch them to the main com-link
system.  Let everyone hear it.</sp>

<sd>The voices of the starpilots are broadcast into the

<sd>BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
Masassi Base, we have visual contact.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="139"><setting>EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN139</setting>

<sd>A small bright speck orbiting the huge red planet of
Yavin sparkles in the light of the distant sun.  Eight
rebel starships settle ominously into the foreground,
moving swiftly toward the orbiting speck.  As the 
starships move closer, the awesome size of the gargan-
tuan Imperial space fortress is revealed.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="140"><setting>INT. BLUE LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING140</setting>

<sd>Blue Leader, in the first ship, signals to the other
pilots in his wing group.  The many monitors are filled
with various computer readouts and displays.  Over the
com-link one of the other starpilots (BLUE SIX) reports
to Blue Leader.</sd>

<sd>BLUE SIX (V.O.)
(intercom)
Look at the size of that thing!</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Cut off, Blue Six.  Stand by.  Blue

Red group, try for the exhaust port.
Settle in.  Here we go.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="141"><setting>INT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING141</setting>

<sd>Luke adjusts the controls of the tiny starfighter and
lowers the sunshade on his goggles.</sd>

Blue Five, does that glare bother

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="142"><setting>EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - BATTLE142</setting>

<sd>Fuel pods are jettisoned.  The starship fighters extend
their dart-like wings and break off into a power dive
attack on the space fortress.  A barrage of laser fire
from the huge fortress creates a wall of death through
which most of the rebel craft miraculously emerge --
undamaged.  Multiple laser bolts streak from the star-
ship fighters, creating small explosions on the complex
surface of the fort.  Luke directs his fire at one of
the prime power terminals.  It explodes, generating
weird electronic arcs that leap off the station's surface.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="143"><setting>-163   INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN STATION143-163</setting>

<sd>Walls buckle and cave in, sucking debris and personnel
into the vacuum of space.  Alarm sirens scream as sol-
diers scramble to large turbo-powered laser gun emplace-
ments.  Officers yell orders through the smoke and con-
fusion.  Man and robots of various shapes and sizes run
to their battle stations.  Standing in the middle of the
chaos, a vision of calm and foreboding, is the evil Sith
knight, Darth Vader.  Several astro-officers run up to
him, still putting on the helmets and equipment.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
Get to your ships.  I'll take the
lead myself.  We finally have them
where we want them.</sp>

</scene>
<scene n="164"><setting>INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM164</setting>

<sd>The princess and her generals listen silently to the
action of the starships over the com-link.  The aides
and troops move about very quietly listening to the
battle as they work.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
Blue One to Masassi Base, we're
nearing the south pole transmitter
area.  The magnetic concussion is
getting very rough.
We're starting our run.  Tighten it
up.  Blue Two, tighten it up.  Watch
those towers.</sd>

<sd>CHEWIE (BLUE TWO)(V.O.)
Heavy fire, boss.  Twenty-three
degrees.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
I see it.  Pull in.  Pull in.  We're
picking up some interference.</sd>

<sd>BLUE SIX (V.O.)
Wow, I've never seen such fire power.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
Pull in, Blue Two.  Pull in.  Chewie,
do you read me?  Chewie?</sd>

<sd>CHEWIE (V.O.)
I'm all right, boss.  I've got a
target.  I'm going in to check it out.</sd>

<sd>BLUE SIX (V.O.)
There is too much action, Chewie.  Get
out!</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
Break off, Chewie.  Acknowledge.
We've hit to much interference.  Blue
Six, can you see Blue Two?</sd>

<sd>BLUE SIX (V.O)
I've lost him.  There's a heavy fire
zone on this side.  My scanner's
jammed.  Blue Five?</sd>

<sd>LUKE (V.O.)
He's gone.  No, wait.  There he is.
Fin damage, but he's all right.</sd>

<sd>A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
Watch your back, Luke.  Watch your
back!  Squad above you, Blue Five!
Coming in -- about six ships.</sd>

<sd>165-171   EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - BATTLE -165-171
REBEL FIGHTERS</sd>

<sd>Two fin-winged Imperial fighters dive on Luke, but he
does a quick spiral turn and eludes them.</sd>

<sd>RED LEADER
Blue Leader, this is Red Leader...
We've marked the target and are
starting our attack run.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
I copy, Red Leader.  We'll try to
keep them busy on this end.  Blue
Five, stay close now...</sd>

<sd>Blue Leader and Luke (Blue Five) and Blue Four dive in
unison through a forest of radar domes, antenna and gun
towers.  They are followed by four Imperial tie fighters.
The two rebel ships make a sharp turn and come around 
behind the Imperial ships.  Blue Four and Blue Leader
fire into the tie fighters as the six ships crisscross
the surface of the fortress.</sd>

<sd>Suddenly a dense barrage of laser fire erupts from a
protruding tower, catching Blue Four broadside.  The
rebel spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces.
Luke has a sudden realization of the danger he is in,
but it quickly fades as another Imperial fighter moves
onto his tail and begins firing.  Luke rolls away from
the enemy ship.</sd>

<sd>Blue Leader reacts to the loss of his wing man with a
renewed attack on the Imperial ships -- one of which
falls away and hits a prime power terminal, creating an
arching spectacle.  A chain reaction is set off, creat-
ing a series of explosions leaping across the surface of
the fortress from terminal to terminal.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="172"><setting>-174   INT. Y WING REBEL STARFIGHTER - RED LEADER COCKPIT172-174</setting>

<sd>A blazing and out of control Red Leader dives toward the
Death Star surface followed by Darth Vader in a small,
spider-like Imperial fighter.</sd>

<sd>RED LEADER
Blue Leader, this is Red Leader.
They hit us before we could get down.
You'll need more air cover.  Sith
Lords...</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="175"><setting>-190   EXT. DEATH STAR - SOUTH POLE175-190</setting>

<sd>Blue Leader see Luke has an Imperial fighter on his
tail.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
We're on our way, Red Leader.</sd>

<sd>Blue Two (Chewie) miraculously dives his ship through
a virtual sea of laser fire and blasts the Imperial
fighters chasing Luke into dust.  Chewie signals to
Luke, who lets out a whooping cheer as Chewie veers
into a victory roll.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Great moves, Chewie.  Red Leader
needs some help.  We're going to try
for the exhaust port.  Coincide, Blue
Five.</sd>

<sd>Luke and Blue Three bob and weave in formation toward a
group of giant towers at the north pole.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
I see the target.  It looks good.</sd>

<sd>BLUE THREE
I've got it.  We're hit!  We're hit!</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Eject... Eject.  Blue Three, do you
read?</sd>

<sd>BLUE THREE
I'm all right.  I can hold it.  Give
me a little room, Blue Five.  Watch
it!  Watch it!</sd>

<sd>Blue Three wobbles a little, then drops away sharply,
plowing into a huge laser gun emplacement, causing a
hideous series of chain reaction explosions.  The re-
maining starships of the Blue group fly in a tight
formation and dive between the tall towers near the
exhaust port.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Masassi Base, we're in position and
staring for the target.  Chewie,
hold your fire until we're within
point zero five four.  Make it count.
Luke, stay close.</sd>

<sd>Several ack-ack lasers begin to open fire on the
approaching spacecraft.  The rebel ships direct their
fire at a small, glowing blue hole at the base of one
of the towers.  One of the Blue Four's engines begins
to smoke and an R-2 unit pops out of the back and
attempts to repair it.</sd>

<sd>CHEWIE (BLUE TWO)
I'm on it.</sd>

<sd>Blue Two dives directly at the small target, is unable
to pull out and crashes into the base of one of the
towers.  Blue Leader dives between the towers, firing
away, but is unable to hit the small hole.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
It's very small.  It's going to be
difficult.  Send in the green group.
I'll try again.</sd>

<sd>Luke chases an Imperial chip that is chasing Blue Leader.</sd>

<sd>One of the two large fins on the Imperial fighter explodes
and it careens wildly, leaving an erratic trail of smoke
before eventually crashing into a solar panel.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="191"><setting>-195   EXT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - BATTLE191-195</setting>

<sd>Luke swings the small craft around the many outcroppings
of laser towers and transmitters.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
What's that?</sd>

<sd>Out of the gloom streaks Darth Vader firing on Blue
Leader.  Luke tries to intercept the Imperial ship, but
Vader outmaneuvers him.  Blue Leader dives on the ex-
haust port, followed by Darth Vader, who is followed by
Luke, desperately trying to catch up.</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Blue Five, break off your cover
attack.  It's too late.  Make your
own run on the exhaust port.  Do 
you copy, Luke?</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Yes, sir, but I can get him...</sd>

<sd>BLUE LEADER
Forget it, son.</sd>

<sd>One of the five large engines on Blue Leader's fighter
explodes.  He careens wildly, leaving an erratic trail
of smoke before eventually crashing into a solar panel.
Luke can hear the sharp laugh of Vader over the com-link.</sd>

</scene>
<scene n="196"><setting>INT. VADER'S IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING  196</setting>

<sd>Darth Vader laughs maniacally as he swings his craft

<sd>Luke's hand instinctively goes to the pocket that holds

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)

<scene n="198"><setting>INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM198</setting>

<sd>On the computer display board, several of the markers
indicating rebel fighters go dark.  The princess gives

GENERAL DODANA approaches the princess.</sd>

<sp spk="DODANA">
Over sixty percent of our craft have

projection shows little hope.  The
Death Star will be in position to
fire on us shortly.  We will be

<sd>The princess gives Dodana a hard look and the cowardly
general back away.</sd>

<sp spk="LEIA">

</scene>
<scene n="199"><setting>-225   EXT. BATTLE199-225</setting>

<sd>Luke (Blue Five) dives on the Death Star at an incredi-
ble speed.  He soon realizes Vader is on his tail.  He
spins his ship to evade the pursuing Dark Lord, but
Vader is still there.  His ship rock and shudders under
the nearby impact of Vader exploding laser bolts.  Luke
straightens his ship out and it skims across the surface
of the fortress, creating a blur.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Approaching target.  I', almost home.</sd>

<sd>VADER (V.O.)
Not yet, my bold friend.</sd>

<sd>Vader hits one of Luke's engines and parts scatter in
all directions.  The ship wobbles, but Luke keeps the
craft on target and fires his torpedo... It explodes
harmlessly to one side of the tiny exhaust port.  He
pulls his ship up to try for another run.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Blast it!  Artoo, we tool a little
back there.  My stability is off
about twelve degrees.  See if you
can't jam the connecting relays.
We have to get stabilized.</sd>

<sd>Artoo pops out of his socket and carefully makes his
way back to the smoldering engine.  Two other rebel
ships make a dive on the exhaust port.  One is blasted
away by Vader, the other fires at the exhaust port and
misses.</sd>

<sd>BLUE EIGHT
There is just too much interference
with that Sith Lord out there.  It's
impossible to get an accurate target
line-up with him there.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Hurry with those relays, Artoo.
We're going to try again.</sd>

<sd>Luke's tiny rebel fighter banks and prepares for a second
attack on the exhaust port.</sd>

<sd>Artoo struggles to repair the damage to one of the huge
engines.  blue Eight moves in next to him.</sd>

<sd>BLUE EIGHT
I'll cover for you, Blue Five.</sd>

<sd>The two rebels start their attack dive.  The surface of
the Death Star races toward them.  Suddenly, streaking
down from above them, Vader and two other Imperial
fighters sweep into view with all of their laser cannons
blazing away.  Laser bolts explode around little Artoo
as he works frantically to repair the stabilizer.  Laser
fire hits Blue Eight and he explodes.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
You were foolish enough to try again,
Blue Five.</sp>

<sd>The three Imperial fighters dive on the lone rebel star-
ship.  Luke struggles to keep control of the ship with
laser bolts streaking past him on all sides.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Blast!</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
The Force is with you, my bold little
friend, but now I have you...</sp>

<sd>Suddenly Vader's wing man explodes into a shower of
burning fragments.  Vader is surprised and looks around
for the cause of his wing man's misfortune.</sd>

<sp spk="VADER">
CTR-5, where did that come from?</sp>

<sd>CTR-5
Collision course... watch out!</sd>

<sd>Heading right for the two Imperial fighters is Han Solo
in the battered old pirate starship.  CTR-5 veers radi-
cally, clipping Vader's solar fin in the maneuver.
Vader spins out of control.  Han blasts CTR-5 to smoke.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">
I noticed you were having some
problems, Blue Five... I thought
I'd help.</sp>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you
in a second.</sd>

<sd>Luke levels his fighter and skims the surface of the
fortress, through a wall of laser fire.  Artoo beeps a
message to Luke.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
That's good, Artoo.  Just keep it
that way.</sd>

<sd>As he passes the exhaust port, Luke fires a torpedo,
which goes directly down the exhaust shaft.  Luke looks
down at the glowing Kiber Crystal in his hand.</sd>

<sd>LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
We did it!  I hit it perfectly.
Let's get out of here.</sd>

<sd>Luke veers sharply away from the Death Star as ominous
rumbles and explosions are heard coming from within the
huge super fortress.  The rebel ship speeds past the
large pirate starship and several other surviving
rebel fighters as they flee from the pending holocaust.
A sudden great flash replaces the fortress, and a rain-
storm of rubble pelts the starships.  Several giant ex-
plosions follow until there is only a smoke cloud where
the mighty fortress once orbited Yavin.</sd>

<sp spk="HAN">

the beautiful young Princess Leia.  Luke and the others
solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before
Princess Leia.  Artoo and Threepio are rather awestruck
at the whole event.  Chewbacca is confused.  Old Ben is
sitting to the right of the Princess, while the Grand
Mouff Tarkin sits on her left.  Leia is dressed in a
long, white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  She
rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck,
then repeats the ceremony with Chewbacca, the robots

troops, who all bow before them.</sd>
