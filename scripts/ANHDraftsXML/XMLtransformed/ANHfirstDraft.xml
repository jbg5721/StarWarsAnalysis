         <setting>SPACE</setting>
         <sd>FADE IN:</sd>
         <sd>A sea of stars is broken by the vast blue surface of 
	the planet, OGANA. Five small moons slowly drift into 
	view from the far side of the planet. The main 
	titles are followed by a roll-up:</sd>
         <sd>	Until the recent GREAT REBELLION, 
		the DAI NOGAS were the most feared 
		warriors in the universe. For one 
		hundred thousand years, generations 
		of DAI perfected their art as the 
		personal bodyguards of the King. 
		They were the chief architects of 
		the invincible ROYAL SPACE FORCE, 
		which expanded the Kings power 
		across the galaxy, from the celes-
		tial equator to the farthest stars.</sd>
         <sd>	Now these legendary warriors are all 
		but extinct. One by one, they have 
		been hunted down and destroyed as 
		enemies of the NEW GALACTIC KINGDOM 
		by a ferocious and sinister rival 
		warrior sect, THE LEGIONS OF LETTOW.</sd>
         <sd>A small silver spacecraft emerges from behind one of 
	the Ogana moons.  The deadly little fightercraft 
	speeds past several of the moons, until it finally 
	goes into orbit around the FOURTH MOON.</sd>
      </scene>
      <scene n="2">
         <setting>VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES- FOURTH MOON - OGANA</setting>
         <sd>A harsh gale blows across the bleak grey surface of 
	the Fourth Moon.  The blood red sky presses down on a 
	lone figure, JUSTIN VALOR, a tall, heavy-set boy of 
	sixteen.   He slowly makes his way across a wierd 
	plain covered with huge sprawling lakes.  The water in 
	some of the lakes is bright red, while in others it is 
	a vivid green.  The oddly colored lakes create an 
	ominous landscape against the eerie red sky.</sd>
         <sd>The heavy winds whip at the young boy and make the 
	going extremely difficult.  His face is covered by a 
	breath mask and goggles.  He stops for a second to 
	adjust the shoulder strap on his chrome multiplelazer 
	rifle.  Something in the sky catches his eye, and he
	instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from 
	his belt.  He stands transfixed for a few moments, 
	studying the heavens, then turns and rushes back in 
	the direction from which he came.</sd>
      </scene>
      <scene n="3">
         <setting>SUPPLY HUT - FOURTH MOON - OGANA</setting>
         <sd>A damaged spacecraft, half buried in the dust, rests 
	next to the remains of an abandoned supply shack.  Justin
	makes his way across the colorless landscape and 
	rushes into the crumbling building.  The interior of 
	the hut is shabby, but manages to abate the howling 
	winds.  Seated in front of a thermoheater are Justin's
	father, AKIRA, and his young brother, BINK.  Akira is 
	a large, burly man, wearing the distinctive robes of a 
	Dai.  Bink is ten years old, with dusty blond hair and 
	a large scratch on his cheek.  Justin slams the door 
	and removes his gear.   His ruggedly handsome face is 
	caked with many layers of dust.</sd>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Dad!  Dad!  They've found us!</sp>
         <sd>Bink looks up from a small cube he has been studying. 
	His father whacks him across the shoulder with a 
	braided wire connector.</sd>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		Continue with the problem.  Your 
		concentration is worse than your 
		brother's.  <sd>to Justin</sd>  How many?</sp>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Only one this time.  A Cao Four.</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		Good.  We may not have to repair 
		this old bucket after all.  Pre-
		pare yourself.</sp>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		Me too!</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		Do you have the answer?</sp>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		I think it's the Corbet dictum: 
		"What is, is without."</sp>
         <sd>Akira smiles.  This is the correct answer.  Justin is
	strapping on a utility belt with chrome lazerpistols 
	and lazersword.  Akira rises and starts for his equip-
	ment.</sd>
         <sp spk="BINK (Cont.)">
		Ahhh, Pop...</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		Bink, do you feel you're ready?</sp>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		Yes, sir.  I've outmarked Justin in 
		twelve disciplines.  I'm as good...</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		All right, son.  Get your gear.</sp>
         <sd>Bink jumps up with the enthusiasm available only to 
	a ten-year old and grabs his gear.  His father frowns 
	and shakes his head.</sd>

      <scene n="4">
         <setting>WASTELAND BLUFF - FOURTH MOON - OGANA</setting>
         <sd>Akira Valor and his two sons carefully make their way
	up a rock bluff overlooking the Lettow spacecraft parked
	among the  colored lakes.Akira inspects the  
	with his electrobinoculars.</sd>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		No tracks.  Bi-lock hasn't been opened.
		Interior systems are still on.</sp>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Are we going to wait for him to come 
		out?</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		He's not  in there.  He's baiting us. 
		I'm surprised they only sent one this 
		time.  We must be wearing them down, 
		or they must think this warrior is 
		something special.  Stay on guard, 
		and keep hidden.  I'm going to work 
		my way across the ridge and call his 
		bluff.  Better we meet in open combat 
		than wait for him to ambush us.  Keep 
		your guard!</sp>
         <sd>Akira leaves his two sons and moves off along the 
	obscured ridge.  Justin and Bink watch him intently. 
	Justin throws down his multiplelazer rifle in dis-
	gust.</sd>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		He should have let me go with him.  
		He's getting too old to make an open 
		challenge.</sp>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		He's not too old to realize you'd 
		just get in the way.</sp>
         <sd>Justin ignores his little brother's remark and sneaks 
	a look over the ridge at the Lettow spacecraft.  Akira 
	moves out of the rocks some distance away and starts 
	toward the starship.  Bink moves to the ridge next to 
	his brother, his chrome lazerrifle sparkling in the 
	reflected red light of Ogana.</sd>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		He's making his move.</sp>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Watch your guard... and cover 
		that weapon.  It shines like a 
		beacon.</sp>
         <sd>Bink reluctantly move away and watches the other 
	direction.  Akira has almost reached the Lettow 
	spacecraft and still there is no sign of its 
	occupant.</sd>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		What's happening?</sp>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Nothing.  I don't like it.</sp>
         <sd>Akira carefully moves to the main hatch of the star-
	ship.  He kicks a valve and the hatch drops open 
	with a loud clank and rushing gas.  Justin becomes 
	more tense as his father carefully moves inside the
	spacecraft.  Everything is still.  Even the continual 
	winds seem to have died down.  Moments pass with no 
	sign of activity inside the enemy starship.  Justin 
	watches the craft with his electrobinoculars.  The 
	waiting becomes unbearable.</sd>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Something's happened!  He's been in 
		there too long.</sp>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		Let me look!  Stand my guard.</sp>
         <sd>Bink takes the electrobinoculars from his brother and 
	studies the silent spacecraft.  Justin impatiently 
	scans the distant red horizon.</sd>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		I think the power just went off. 
		We'd better wait here until some-
		one comes out.</sp>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		What if he needs help?</sp>
         <sp spk="BINK">
		The power went back on again....</sp>
         <sd>With the aid of the electrobinoculars, Bink watches 
	the running lights of the starship flash on and off.
	Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field 
	of vision.  Before either of the two young boys can 
	react, a large, sinister Lettow warrior in black 
	robes and a face mask  looms over them.  He carries 
	a long lazersword which cuts young Bink down before 
	he or his brother is able to raise his weapon.  The 
	startled Justin backs away in horror, then settles 
	down and ignites his lazersword which creates an 
	eerie red glow.  He stumbles over rocks as he attempts 
	to avoid the charging Lettow warrior.  The evil 
	warrior swings his mighty lazersword, but Justin 
	manages to deflect the intended deathblow.</sd>
         <sd>Finally, Justin is able to assume a defensive stance, 
	and the two warriors stand, sizing up each other.  The 
	legionnaire is at least seven feet tall, and dwarfs 
	the young Dai.  They stand for a few moments, almost 
	frozen, then in a flurry of blows, lazerswords clash 
	with the sound of electric snapping and popping. 
	Justin is barely able to hold his own against the 
	experienced warrior.  Many blows are exchanged before 
	the Lettow warrior is able to back Justin up against 
	a deep crevasse.  Justin stumbles and almost falls 
	over the cliff to his death.</sd>
         <sd>The legionnaire suddenly senses something behind him 
	and whirls around to face Justin's father, Akira Valor, 
	a Dai Nogas master.  The Lettow warrior raises his 
	lazersword, but is cut in two before he can bring it 
	down again.  Akira moves to the fallen legionnaire 
	and studies him carefully.  Justin, still a little 
	wobbly from the whole experience, attempts to stand. 
	Akira sees his dead son Bink and goes to him.  He 
	lifts him into his arms and begins to weep.  Justin 
	stands bewildered, watching his father cradle the 
	dead child.</sd>

      <scene n="5">
         <setting>INTERIOR LETTOW STARSHIP - VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES - 
	OGANA</setting>
         <sd>Akira Valor slides into one of the four seats of the
	small Lettow starship.  Through the front viewing 
	canopy, he watches Justin drag Bink's body to a small
	crevasse.  Justin places a small locket around his 
	brother's neck, makes a complicated sign, and dumps 
	the body into the shallow depression.  The giant 
	engines of the spacecraft begin to whine, kicking up 
	large clouds of dust.</sd>
         <sd>Justin climbs into the seat beside his father and 
	removes his breath mask and goggles.   There are 
	tears in his eyes.  Father and son look out across 
	the wasteland towards Bink's grave.  The thunderous 
	clap of an explosion is followed by a small mushroom 
	cloud rising out of the depression.  Justin throws a
	container down in a fit of rage.</sd>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		How many more of them are there?  I 
		want to finish it, once and for all. 
		I'm sick of running.  When will it 
		stop?</sp>
         <sd>Justin's father waits silently until the tirade is
	finished.  Justin sits silently for a few moments.</sd>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN (Cont.)">
		I'm sorry.</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		Son, plot a course for TOWNOWI.</sp>
         <sd>Justin lights up like a Geenick at feeding time.</sd>
         <sp spk="JUSTIN">
		Townowi!  You mean we're going home?</sp>
         <sp spk="AKIRA">
		We both need a rest.</sp>
         <sd>Akira pulls back on the throttle and the powerful 
	spaceship lifts off the surface of the Fourth Moon 
	of Ogana.</sd>

         <setting>CLOUD SEA - GRANICUS</setting>
         <sd>A title card appears over a sea of billowing clouds 
	on the gaseous planet of GRANICUS:</sd>
         <sd>	Granicus:   Capital of the New 
		Galactic Empire.</sd>
         <sd>The towering yellow oxide clouds pass, revealing the 
	Royal City of Granicus.  The magnificent domed and 
	gleaming city is perched, mushroom-like, on a tall 
	spire which disappears deep into the misty surface 
	of the planet.  The peacefulness of this nebulous 
	idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion 
	engines.  Four sleek stardestroyers from the Royal 
	Fleet burst out of the huge cumulus range.  The 
	craft are flying in a tight formation as they bank 
	steeply, and head toward the royal   capital of the 
	New Galactic Kingdom.</sd>
      </scene>
      <scene n="7">
         <setting>INTERIOR STARDESTROYER - GRANICUS</setting>
         <sd>Stardestroyers are two-man spacecraft crammed with
	sophisticated electronic weaponry.  The pilot and 
	gunnery officers sit side-by-side surrounded by 
	lighted readouts and switches.  They wear the gleaming 
	black uniforms of the Kings elite corps.</sd>
         <sp spk="PILOT">

         <sp spk="PILOT">
		Use your face shield, Chick-One.</sp>
         <sd>The pilot is cold and professional as he maneuvers 
	his craft closer to the others.  The positions of 
	the ships are displayed on a read-out, along with a 
	graphic representation of the city.  The pilot gives 
	the gunner a quick look before he flips his sunshield 
	over his eyes.</sd>

      <scene n="8">
         <setting>REVIEW STAND - PLAZA OF THE DONNS - GRANICUS</setting>
         <sd>On a huge austere platform stands the dark SON HHAT, 
	Lord of Granicus, Consul to the Supreme Tribunal, and 
	ruler of the Galactic Kingdom.  He is a thin gray 
	looking man with an evil mustache hanging limply 
	over his insidious lip.  Standing at rigid attention 
	on his right are several generals  dressed in the 
	black and grey uniform of the realm.  Five members 
	of the Supreme Tribunal sit off to the side.  On 
	Hhat's    left stands MARA HORUS, newly appointed 
	Governor of the Townowi Systems.  He is a young 
	treacherous man with stone-cut angular features and 
	piercing gray eyes.</sd>
         <sd>They all gaze skyward as the four gleaming star-
	destroyers scream low overhead in an impressive 
	barrel-roll formation.  As the sound of the space-
	craft resonates throughout the glass canyon of the 
	Plaza, the group of dignitaries return their atten-
	tion to the parade of  royal   shock troops and 
	giant air tanks (which ride magically, two or three 
	feet above the ground).</sd>
         <sd>The Plaza of the Donns is filled with hundreds of rows 
	of troops as the last brigade marches into position. 
	The sound of three thousand men snapping to attention 
	is followed by a strange silence.  A light wind blows 
	the great red banner of the kingdom creating a subtle
	flapping sound.  The king's amplified voice startles 
	many of the troops as it cuts through the quiet.</sd>
         <sp spk="SON HHAT">
		Upon this battle depends the survival 
		of the Galactic Kingdom. Upon this 
		battle depends the life and long con-
		tinuity of our civilization.  Not 
		since the great Dai Rebellion has our 
		destiny been placed in such a balance. 
		This is to be the most magnificent 
		campaign of all!  You have never been 
		called without doing something to be 
		remembered, something notable and 
		striking.  The conquering of the 
		Townowi System, the last of the inde-
		pendent systems and the last refuge 
		of the outlawed, vile sect of the Dai, 
		will have such important and lasting 
		consequences, that I can't but consider 
		it as an epoch in history.</sp>
         <sd>To the rear of the Plaza, watching the spectacle over 
	the shoulder of a curious bureaucrat, stands CLIEG OXUS, 
	a tall, blond young man about twenty years old.  He seems
	interested in what the  King   has to say, but keeps 
	looking around nervously as if someone were after him. 
	His arm rests across his head, as he carefully but coolly
	adjusts a glowing blue ring on his index finger.  The 
	King nears the end of his speech.  Mara Horus has moved 
	up to stand next to the sinister monarch.  The troops 
	shout a royal salute in response to a particularly 
	partisan statement.</sd>
         <sp spk="SON HHAT (Cont.)">
		... I have personally asked the Townowians 
		to accept this Treaty of Alliance.  During 
		the period of negotiation, they have only 
		decided to be undecided.  We will barter no 
		longer.  Governor Horus has been appointed 
		the First Lord of the Townowi System and 
		Surrounding Territories.  This is the last 
		frontier and the final stone in the great 
		wall of the Galactic Kingdom.</sp>
         <sd>The troops cheer, and the King escorts Horus inside.
	Oxus moves quickly away from the Plaza, passing through
	several check stations, where he is forced to show his
	identification.</sd>

         <sd>Oxus walks into the glass and chrome splendor of one 
	of the famous nightclubs of Granicus.  He moves to the 
	long mirrored bar and sits next to a rough looking man, 
	BOMOJE ESPAA, dressed in the distinctive gold and furs 
	of the galactic traders.</sd>
         <sp spk="OXUS">

         <sp spk="OXUS">
		Just a dantic, then.  Espaa, it's 
		not like you to refuse a drink. 
		You're going to give the galactic 
		traders a bad name.</sp>
         <sd>A drink appears magically from a small elevator in the 
	bar.  Oxus takes it, and then places a pen-like trans-
	mitter he has taken from his pocket next to the inter-

         <sd>They are interrupted by a royal officer and several

         <sd>The palace library is a dim, cool room, projecting an 
	aura of time-worn comfort and security.  In the 
	distance, the children can be heard screaming through 
	the corridors.  KING KAYOS, silver haired but amazingly 
	youthful under a tanned and leathery face, motions for 
	one of his aides to shut the partially closed door. 
	He is in the middle of an emergency meeting of the 
	Townowi High Senate.  The twelve men sit in overstuffed 
	chairs, placed in a large circle.  A large, sallow-eyed 
	galactic trader named AAY ZAVOS, fiddlesnervously with 
	a small scrap of leather as he speaks.</sd>
         <sp spk="ZAVOS">
		My Lord, the chrome companies are with

		they can't openly support you.  Royal 
		trade restrictions are very unfavorable 
		and we, of course, favor your indepen-

         <sp spk="KAYOS">

		frigates still supply us?</sp>
         <sp spk="ZAVOS">

         <sd>COUNT SANDAGE, a corrupt noble of the senate, jumps to 
	his feet in a rage.</sd>
         <sp spk="SANDAGE">
		This is nonsense!  We have no choice 
		but to approve the treaty.  If there 
		is war, the New Galactic Kingdom will 
		destroy our entire system with a snap 
		of the finger.  General Skywalker is 
		a dreamer if he thinks he can mount 
		any meaningful resistance, and you're 
		dreamers if you believe him.  So much 
		trust in one aged man.  You must see...</sp>
         <sd>At that moment, all heads turn as someone enters the 
	room.  It is General Luke Skywalker, Commander of the 
	Townowi Star Force.  He is a large man, apparently in 
	his early forties, but actually much older.  Every-
	one senses the aura of power that radiates from this 
	great warrior.  Here is a leader:  a Dai general.  He 
	looks weary, but is still a magnificent looking warrior. 
	His face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is 
	set off by a close silver beard, and dark, penetrating 
	eyes.  Sandage is somewhat embarrassed and quietly sits 
	down.</sd>
         <sp spk="SKYWALKER">
		Is there anyone here so naive he 
		believes the Galactic Kingdom 
		would even bother negotiating if 
		they were contemplating destruction 
		of this system?  Your Excellencies, 
		this is more than a simple raid on 
		your resources.  You must reach a

         <sp spk="NASH">

         <sp spk="SKYWALKER">

	cracking voice.</sd>
         <sp spk="TARKIN">
		An actual war with the Galactic Kingdom
		is still only a remote possibility.  As 
		a military treatise, your proposal has 
		certain merits, but in the harsh light 
		of reality, an attack against the Galac-
		tic Kingdom appears to be a somewhat 
		extreme defense.</sp>
         <sp spk="NASH">
		You must understand, General, were
		interested in avoiding a war, not 
		starting one.</sp>
         <sp spk="SKYWALKER">
		There are times when offense makes

		All right, then.  May the force

         <sd>The senators leave in a flurry of hushed conversation. 
	The general is lost in thought, and remains in his chair. 
	Oeta and Puck, King Kayos two young sons, storm through 
	the existing senators, and rush on to Kayos' lap.  The 
	King is obviously very proud of the two young princes. 
	He throws Oeta into the air, and then catches him again.</sd>

         <sp spk="KAYOS">
		Okay, whippersnapper, go tell your

		my way.</sp>
         <sd>The two boys run out of the room and are heard yelling 
	and screaming down the hallway. The king starts out, but
	stops in front of the general.</sd>
         <sp spk="KAYOS">

	years old, possessing a soft beauty and iron will, is
	embracing her mother, QUEEN BREHA, a warm, silver-
	haired matron.  There are tears in the princess' blue

	He gives her a fatherly smile, and she hugs him again.

	cess and Mina hug Alana, whose giggles have turned to 
	tears.  The two boys scramble out of the speeder as 
	Amber helps the princess and her maid into the back 
	seat.  The speeder is piloted by a trooper of the 
	first order.  Amber jumps into the seat beside him,

         <sd>A loud uproar is heard on the far side of the war room.
	Everyone turns to see a foreign dressed warrior pushing 
	his way past several guards and war-room bureaucrats. 
	The warrior, with his long hair tied in an odd bun on

         <sd>As the dauntless Akira approaches the general, the guards
	stop in bewilderment as General Skywalker rushes up to 
	the warrior and embraces him.  The two Dai warriors 
	laugh jubilantly and slap one another, as the aides and

         <sp spk="SKYWALKER">

         <sd>Akira Valor suddenly ignites in a rage and swings 
	his left forearm down with a mighty blow across the 
	solid chrome desk the general is sitting at.  The 
	old Dai warrior's forearm cracks in two, spewing forth 
	wires  and many fine multicolored electronic components. 
	The artificial limb flops lifelessly to Valor's side. 
	The warrior rips open his tunic, revealing a plastic 
	chest stuffed with flashing electronic parts.</sd>
         <sp spk="AKIRA (angrily)">
		I'm not the same.  There is nothing

	branches.  Below him he can see a group of scruffy alien 
	trappers sitting around a nutron stove, joking and telling 
	stories.  Parked on either side of the group are two large, 
	tank-like jungle-crawlers.  Behind the crawlers, five Jawas 
	(huge gray and furry beasts) hang upside down in a tree. 
	Occasionally they thrash about in great anger and frustration.</sd>
         <sd>The trappers speak in a strange language, and although they 
	appear slightly human, they are slimy, deformed, hideous 
	looking creatures.  Two of the trappers yell at each other 
	in a friendly argument.  One shirtless creature goes into a 
	crawler and the remaining eight laugh hysterically.  Captain 
	Valor moves further out on the limb to get a better view.  A 
	couple  of pieces of bark break loose, and float a hundred 
	feet to the ground.  The trappers fail to notice.  Moments 
	later, the shirtless trapper emerges from the crawler with 
	the princess held unconscious and half naked over his head. 
	Valor's rage knows no bounds.  With a terrifying Dai war cry, 
	the young captain jumps from the tree, sails over a hundred 
	feet, and with great agility, lands in the middle of the 
	startled trappers.  In one continuous rapid motion, he ignites 
	his lazersword and cuts down three of the vile creatures.  The 
	shirtless trapper swings the princess over his shoulder  and	 
	runs back into the huge jungle crawler.  Two other trappers 
	reach for their pistols, but the Dai has killed them before 
	their weapons can clear leather.  The three remaining 
	creatures have their pistols out and start firing.  Explosions 
	erupt all around Valor.  One blast hits the branch holding 
	the Jawas  and they collapse with a loud screech in a heap. 
	One of the trappers is caught in the crossfire and is blown 
	apart.</sd>
         <sd>When the smoke clears  Valor lies unconscious amid the 
	burning rubble.  The jungle crawler begins to move out of the 
	camp.  The last two trappers run after it.  One is able to 
	jump on board, but the second trapper runs too close to the 
	now freed Jawas.  Boma, one of the furry giants, grabs him 
	and snaps him in two, like a stick of wood.  The jungle 
	crawler disappears in the forest mist.  The eight foot Boma, 
	who resembles a huge, gray bushbaby with fierce baboon-like 
	fangs, struggles to free his companions.</sd>
         <sd>Valor regains semi-consciousness, and attempts to get up, only 
	to groan and collapse back into unconsciousness.  The Jawas 
	gather around him and poke him a couple of times to see if 
	he is still alive.  They squawk and jabber, apparently in 
	some kind of argument.  Finally, Wann, the largest of the Jawas 
	picks up Valor and puts him over his shoulder.  The group

	hovers over the trap door.  A sinister grin sweeps across

	puts the chrome ball back into his pocket.</sd>

         <sd>Lazerfire from the space fortress creates a wall of death, 
	which the three squadron of Jawa starships miraculously 
	emerge through undamaged.  The general barks orders to the 
	Jawa craft and Boma and his squadron break off and start an 
	attack dive.  Lazerfire from Bomas brightly colored ship 
	hits one of the prime power terminals on the fortress sur-
	face.  It explodes, creating weird electric arcs as it goes.</sd>
         <sd>Han and the general also concentrate fire on the distinctive 
	black power terminals.  Two more are destroyed in an arcing 
	spectacle.  A chain reaction is set off, creating a series of 
	explosions leaping across the surface of the fortress from 
	power terminal to power terminal.</sd>

         <sd>The shock of the explosion can be felt over the rumbling of 
	the trash masher.  The wall has moved within a few yards of 
	squashing Dodona, Valor and the princess.  They are still 
	frantically trying to somehow stop the relentless wall, to 
	no avail.  The lights blink off, then on again  and the 
	moving wall rumbles to a halt.  Zara breathes a sigh of 
	relief.</sd>

         <sd>			 A-2
		Hey!  Over there.
		
	The trio turn and see little A-2 standing at the other end of
