					 ----------------------
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
	A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
	title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup 
	slowly crawls into infinity.
   It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic
Empire.
   During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station
with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
   Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
	The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
	eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
	silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from
	the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a
	giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts
	streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar
	fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.



<scene n="1">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN PASSAGEWAY.
	An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2)
	and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the
	shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. 
	Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of
	computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the
	other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He
	has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco
	design. 
		 Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their
	way.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll
be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
		</sp>
      <sd> Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions
	in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> We're doomed!
		</sp>
      <sd> The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
	only another robot could understand.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
	loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
	are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> What's that?
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="2">
      <sd>EXTERIOR: SPACECRAFT IN SPACE.
	The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
	Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
	underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="3">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.
	The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
	tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a
	score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their
	way into the smoke-filled corridor.
		 In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
	laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
	creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
	behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
	who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
	arms and faces.
		 An explosion hits near the robots.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> I should have known better than to trust the logic of a
half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
	around the two hapless robots.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="4">
      <sd>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT WASTELAND -- DAY.
	A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The
	tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure,
	Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks
	much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and
	baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with
	a prize-winning smile.
		 A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
	large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
	desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by
	a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
	appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
	A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he
	instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility
	belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the
	heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
	Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
	above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny
	robot to follow him.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
		</sp>
      <sd> The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
	smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms
	up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his
	Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="5">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN HALLWAY.
	The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his
	way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is
	Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured
	by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
	stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
	Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from
	the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the
	Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a
	frenzied panic.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="6">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.
	A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
	Artoo makes beeping sounds.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="7">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.
	Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
	nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
	soldiers can be heard in the distance.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
		</sp>
      <sd> A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
	he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a
	smoke-filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen
	years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,
	dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
	something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
	robot joins his companion.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> At last! Where have you been?</sp>
      <sd>Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows
what!
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
	subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Wait a minute, where are you going?
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="8">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- CORRIDOR
	The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
	of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
	an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
</sd>
      <sp spk="IMPERIAL OFFICER"> The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
		</sp>
      <sd> Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
	in vain.
</sd>
      <sp spk="VADER"> Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
		</sp>
      <sd> Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
</sd>
      <sp spk="VADER"> What have you done with those plans?
</sp>
      <sp spk="REBEL OFFICER"> We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a
consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
</sp>
      <sp spk="VADER"> If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador?
		</sp>
      <sd> The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
	Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
	gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
	Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
	his troops.
</sd>
      <sp spk="VADER"> Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans
and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
		</sp>
      <sd> The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="9">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.
	The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
	stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
	Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes
	slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the
	approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers
	spots her.
</sd>
      <sp spk="TROOPER"> There she is! Set for stun!
		</sp>
      <sd> Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
	her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
	paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.
</sd>
      <sp spk="TROOPER"> She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="10">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.
	Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He
	snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
	begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the
	cramped four-man pod.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll
be deactivated for sure..
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo beeps something to him.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of
grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
	the mission he is about to perform.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm
not getting in there!
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
	and twangs angrily.
	A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
	through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,
	after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky
	robot jumps into the lifepod.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> I'm going to regret this.
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="11">
      <sd>INTERIOR: IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER.
	On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified
	robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
</sd>
      <sp spk="CHIEF PILOT"> There goes another one.
</sp>
      <sp spk="CAPTAIN"> Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been
short-circuited.
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="12">
      <sd>INTERIOR: LIFEPOD.
	Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
	Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.</sp>
      <sd>Artoo beeps an assuring response.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Are you sure this things safe?
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="13">
      <sd>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.
	Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
	buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty
	street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of
	the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as
	he flies past.
</sd>
      <sp spk="WOMAN"> I've told you kids to slow down!
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="14">
      <sd>INTERIOR: POWER STATION -- DAY.
	Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged
	mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
	asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the
	office, yelling wildly.
</sd>
      <sp spk="FIXER"> Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
</sp>
      <sp spk="CAMIE"> It was just wormie on another rampage.
		</sp>
      <sd> Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
	and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
	playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
	handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city
	attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the
	farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Shape it up you guys!.... Biggs?
		</sp>
      <sd> Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to
	great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be
here...certainly didn't expect you to be out working. <sd>he laughs.</sd>
      </sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon?
Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
		</sp>
      <sd> Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
</sd>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.
First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...<sd>he salutes</sd>...I just
came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
		</sp>
      <sd> Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing
	friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out
	of it.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our
system. Come and look!
</sp>
      <sp spk="DEAK"> Not again! Forget it.
</sp>
   </scene>
   <scene n="15">
      <sd>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD -- SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.
	The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and
	The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke
	has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> There they are!
		</sp>
      <sd> Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain
	to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
	Biggs sees two small silver specks.
</sd>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> That's no battle, hot shot...they're just sitting there!
Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> But there was a lot of firing earlier...
		</sp>
      <sd> Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
	building in the process. Luke grabs them.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Hey, easy with those...
</sp>
      <sp spk="CAMIE"> Don't worry about it, Wormie.
		</sp>
      <sd> The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy
	shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
</sd>
      <sp spk="FIXER"> I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I
doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me
Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
		</sp>
      <sd> Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
	group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
	Luke's ineptitude.
</sd>
   </scene>
   <scene n="16">
      <sd>INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- HALLWAY
	Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
	of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is
	brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
	marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
	emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard
	at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LEIA"> Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The
Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked
a diplomatic...
</sp>
      <sp spk="VADER"> Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any
mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted
system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LEIA"> I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the
Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
</sp>
      <sp spk="VADER"> You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her
away!
		</sp>
      <sd> Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the
	smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial
	Commander turns to Vader.
</sd>
      <sp spk="COMMANDER"> Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it
could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
</sp>
      <sp spk="VADER"> I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link
to find their secret base!
</sp>
      <sp spk="COMMANDER"> She'll die before she tells you anything.
</sp>
      <sp spk="VADER"> Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the
senate that all aboard were killed!
		</sp>
      <sd> Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the
	Commander. They stop and snap to attention.
</sd>
      <sp spk="SECOND OFFICER"> Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard
this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was
jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
		</sp>
      <sd> Vader turns to the Commander.
</sd>
      <sp spk="VADER"> She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a
detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

      <sp spk="COMMANDER"> Yes, sir.

	Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas
	meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
	kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
	work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the
	distance rests half buried in the sand.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We
seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost
frozen.

      <sd> Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> What a desolate place this is.
		</sp>
      <sd> Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and
	starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
	stops and yells at him.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Where are you going?
		</sp>
      <sd> A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
	robot.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way
is much easier.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo counters with a long whistle.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> What makes you think there are settlements over there?
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Don't get technical with me.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just
about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a
day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
		</sp>
      <sd> Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in
	the direction of the vast dune sea.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> And don't let me catch you following me begging for help,
because you won't get it.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
	off in the direction of the towering mesas.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

      <sd> Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the

	Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune;

	mesas. 
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He
tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
		</sp>
      <sd> In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the
	sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint
	of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
	towards him.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!

</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE">
         <sd>Very animated</sd>...so I cut off my power, shut down the
afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest
of the season. You should have been there...it was fantastic.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest
bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are
dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing
more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant
starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft

tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust...and if I don't
come back, I want somebody to know.

</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> What are you talking about?
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> I made some friends at the Academy. <sd>he whispers</sd>...when our

      <sp spk="BIGGS"> My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make
contact.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Your crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what
I can on my own...It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not
going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion
is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe
in. 
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> And I'm stuck here...
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get
your chance to get off this rock.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot
of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left...they've even raided
the outskirts of Anchorhead.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one
blaster.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place
pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems
to be important or what really is important. What good is all your
uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...You know they're
starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be
long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater
glory of the Empire.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't
bother with this rock.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> Things always change.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> I wish I was going...Are you going to be around long? 
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> No, I'm leaving in the morning...
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Then I guess I won't see you.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> Maybe someday...I'll keep a lookout.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Well, I'll be at the Academy next season...after that who knows.
I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...Take
care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
</sp>
      <sp spk="BIGGS"> So long, Luke.

      <sd>EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SUNSET.
	The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
	foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
	fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
	canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes.
	He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a
	moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
		 In the distance, a pepple tumbles down the steep canyon
	wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little
	further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair
	of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow
	path.
		 The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
	suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
	of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one
	short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back.
	His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off
	again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than
	Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they
	cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and
	their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
	seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the
	heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the
	trail.

	The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge

	small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large
	tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked
	into the giant machine.

	It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo
	switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
	around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty
	metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
	maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper
	and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end
	of the chamber.

	while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls
	out from the gloom.

	The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
	battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of
	the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
	homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
	surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small
	adobe block house.
		 The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,
	straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented
	metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly,
	attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths
	and nostrils should be.
		 Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen
	Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes
	are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully
	inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-
	shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little
	Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales
	pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
		 A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
	homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru
	standing in the main courtyard.

      <sd> As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots
	back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little
	beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is
	restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
</sd>
      <sd> Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two
	robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head

      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm
not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling

good. Were you on a cruiser or...

      <sd> The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke
	tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch
	three-dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,
	being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a
	rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit
	garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

What is that?

</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of
these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I
don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain
Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?

      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking
about?
</sp>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out
beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.

      <sp spk="LUKE"> I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better
play back the whole thing.
		</sp>
      <sd> Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
</sd>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his
recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be
able to play back the entire recording.
		</sp>
      <sd> Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and
	hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
</sd>
      <sp spk="LUKE"> H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me
if I take this off! Okay.

	is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien

	scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben

      <sp spk="BARTENDER"> Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want

</sp>
      <sp spk="THREEPIO"> I heartily agree with you sir.</sp>
      <sd>Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the

		</sd>
      <sd> Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall-
	savage-looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey
	with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a
	fur-covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
	Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,
	and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a
	sight to behold.
</sd>
      <sd>Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times
	during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets
	out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit
	disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between
	Ben and the giant Wookiee.</sd>
      <sd>&gt;Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips
	his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear
	or whatever.</sd>
      <sd>A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.</sd>
      <sp spk="CREATURE"> Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
		</sp>
      <sd> The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore
	the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby

      <sd> The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar
	moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His

      <sp spk="BEN"> This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you
something...
		</sp>
      <sd> A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the
	young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through
	tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking
	liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a
	wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old
	Ben. The bartender panics.
</sd>
      <sp spk="BARTENDER"> No blasters! No blaster!

      <sd> With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to
	life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is
	cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,
	cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off
	his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke,
	shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts
	to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.
	The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a
	respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his
	bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points
