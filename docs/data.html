                    The Cytograph displayed shows the 5 drafts that eventually led to the final release of Star Wars: A New Hope. Many characters between the 
                    different versions went by different names and had different roles. Some characters from the various drafts transfer over between version 
                    such as Luke, however his role would get passed around to Annikin (this being a prototype of Anakin in the Prequels). Many stock characters 
                    and side roles remain the same between positions, however some of the characters are dropped entirely between versions, remaining as one off 
                    character concepts before they become refined, with others coming about in the final draft.

                <p class="texts">In additon, we as a group also created several graphs throughout the course of our research of Star Wars this semester, particularly when it 
                    came to the diaglogs involving Luke and Vader. We have attached these charts on this webpage for your refrence. These characters have been 
                    very consistent throughout the five drafts that were analyzed, but the dialog count definitely differed throughout the movie. Luke is the 
                    main hero and Vader is the main villian in the Star Wars movie.</p>
